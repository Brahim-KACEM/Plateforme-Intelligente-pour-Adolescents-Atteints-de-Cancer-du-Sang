"Why carry on if I can't even afford to live?It's all my own fault for being selfish and wanting to do a Masters degree. I barely have enough time to work on my Masters because I have to work four shifts a week in a minimum-eage job to pay my house and bills and still barely have £10 a week leftover for food and other necessities. And now my shifts are being cut down to two shifts a week. I'll have more time to work on my Masters degree but I won't even be able to afford bus fare to go to class or the library, or even food. I'm even at the point of selling my own things to get money that I need.  I can't afford to live so why bother?

Even if I drop out of my Masters now and start full-time work to support myself I'm still going to want to die because I'll be heartbroken to have given up my dreams and also everyone will be disappointed in me for dropping out. I don't see any point in carrying on. I'm exhausted. ",2.0

"It's my 21st next week and all i want to do is dieI'm tired. I don't know why I'm all of a sudden feeling so depressed and suicidal again.. Things were going so great. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm working with the county, social workers, etc., to get me back into work, school, housing.. everything that I need right now... I have a wife that says he loves me, but things are starting to feel dull and I even got tempted to start sexting again, just to feel appreciated. Just to get attention from someone that ""loves"" me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Three times I've cried in bed next to my wife and he just ignored and played video games because I brought it upon myself. I'm tired of being belittled. I'm tired of struggling to have to fight the urge to go through the process of growing up and just be an adult already. I was never given the chance to be a child, to be a teenager, to be a young adult... I'm just expected to be mature already. I've been told by adults that I'm ""very mature"" for my age, but by my very two close friends that I relax around I'm ""childish"" and ""immature."" What the fuck am I. 

&amp;#x200B;

It doesn't help that I feel like I have to now put on a mask around my wife. The one person that I thought I could be myself around.. guess not. Guess I have to put on my outside face around him. I guess I have to be the cold hearted, tough, ""mature"" individual around him now... or maybe not. Maybe I can stop fighting finally. Maybe I can relax... I made it.

"My purpose...It's a cruel joke perhaps for I am not a functional member of society, I could never be, I can work but only a few weeks after that my body hurts, depression takes whole and I'm left to compare myself to those who seem to do anything but work, they would hold more than 2 jobs and never give a second thought to their very reason of being.  


What a joke it must be to have all these thought, all these questions have an eye for the beauty of the world, have the compassion for all living things, all the love on people and places and having no money or loved ones to shared them with.  


I'm do not excel in field, I don't even exercise my profession, I'm not a good writer or a good photographer, I'm not good at putting my thoughts into words, describing people or places. I wish I'd be religious (Not really) so I could say ""I am cursed"" it would be such an easy thing.  


So I serve no purpose for me, for the world, for loved ones, I thought before that taking my own life would be a tragedy or a selfish act because there's always family and/or friends who would miss you, after all we don't experience our own deaths, but now not so much, I mean sure some people my remember me my family would mourn for a while but that would be all, they don't see me, they only think of me so not much would change.  


I know as I've been on the other side reading this, I know that there are people who really care and don't want me to do anything foolish, rest assure I won't for I promise myself I won't and I wish to travel, however I'm afraid I would die before I accomplish this if I do so I hope I can still write to you and share pictures.  


So I am insignificant, what I see, what I feel, wherever I go, nothing and no one will remember me or care, everything would be in vain... forgotten, isolated, segregated, marginalized.",2.0

"How effective are ""safety plans"" really?I've struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts pretty much my entire life but last week was probably the worst I have ever been. I had a plan, a timeline and was ready to go but I've managed to pull out of it.

All the suicide prevention stuff I've seen says I should have a ""safety plan"" - people I can call, things I can do to distract myself, places I can go to be safe, all that. Thing is, I had all those things available to me already and I didn't use them when I was at my worst. I even thought about calling someone and completely rejected the idea.

Maybe I didn't want to do anything because deep down I knew I wasn't serious, but isn't being resistant to getting help a big part of the problem in the first place?

It seems like even if I have a safety plan I either won't need it because I'm not really serious or I won't use it because I am.

Anyone have any safety plan success stories or other thoughts?",2.0

it may have been a few weeks ago now and she may be over what i did, but what she said still leaves an aching pit in my stomach.

i was just put on an antidepressant and i was doing so so well, but after everything thats going on... i just feel empty and worthless. my suicidal thoughts are back and i cant stop them. these thoughts and my anxieties wear my down and are slowly drowning me. 

i dont know what to do anymore, i dont know how to handle myself. im such a worthless, disgusting, poor excuse of a daughter and im so unbelievably sorry. i just want to end myself, ive fucked up so much that i dont know how much i care anymore.

im addicted to self harm, its my crutch whenever im feeling numb and i hate it. self harm makes me feel even more worthless and shitty, but its the only thing that makes me feel anything anymore.

if i go to open up to someone, it's usually the same friend. i feel like he just understands me best. so i aksed if i could tell him something and he said sure. i was venting to him about my fear of the future after we graduate college in the spring. eventually he got tired of me and said ive talked about this issue too much and he sounds like a broken record, he doesn't know how to help, he's too busy with other issues to think about a problem like this, and he's generally been pretty mentally unwell the apst few days. i had seriously had no clue he felt this bad. i felt terrible for bothering him, i apologized and said i just wanted to vent and wasn't really looking for a solid answer or advice on things, but thanked him anyway. i ended it at that. i left immediately i felt so fucking bad 

&amp;#x200B;

i didnt mean to bother you. i know i talk about it a lot. its because im scared of it. i know how annoying it sounds. i dont even like talking about it with my friends that often because i knew they would get annoyed. i i know there's only so many times you can bring this issue up with someone before you start to sound annoying. i know i know i know i  know and im sorry. i didnt mean to burden you. 

&amp;#x200B;

i really really didnt mean to. im sorry, this is why i hate myself because i burden those i care about. this is why i never like opening up to people because i know it just causes them pain. im so sorry i know he hates me know im so sorry im so sorry im sosorry i wish i could change i wish i could be happy i wish i didnt worry i know i know im sorry

"Will attempt suicide tomorrow(again)Well, i'm on a very shitty day again. Will attempt suicide by jumping in front of a train tomorrow. Since it's a 1 way shot, i would say i have 20% chance of actually overcoming my survival instinct and jumping just in time to be shred to pieces.

"Planning on killing myself tonightI’m leaving this here as a place to put down some of my final thoughts. I’ve enjoyed very little of my life, I’m 20 soon turning 21 and I have no periods of my life that I look back fondly on. I’m currently attending college which I find miserable for a degree I hate but my father insists I get. 
       I spent my high school years either being alone, working or helping my mother with my grandfather. I don’t regret helping my mother, but I do regret everything else. My mother is an alcoholic, she’s better now but in the past living with her was a complete nightmare. I have 2 sisters, one which I was never close too, and another who I was but don’t speak to anymore because she went away to college and made it very clear she was never returning here. I don’t blame her, but I do resent her for leaving her younger brother alone to deal with our mother and everything else.
      I was bullied very badly in school and never received any help, I’m surprised I didn’t kill myself back then. Thinking about it now I wish I had. There is no better for me, there’s no light at the end of the tunnel. I’m going to take my fathers heart and diabetes medication tonight and hope I never wake up.

"Afraid I'll do something stupidI've been idealizing suicide for most of my life now. I think about something related to killing myself, how I would go through with it, how it would impact those around me, my family, my friends, how it would impact people I haven't seen in years and such almost every day or every other day and I've been doing it for years. 

I worry about my future often. I am in anguish about it even. This makes it very hard for me to have a positive outlook on things. But the main reason why I feel like giving up on life is the loneliness I feel. I don't connect to people, I very rarely feel something genuine for people in my life and I'm certain it's reciprocal. When I do feel something a bit more, it's always unrequited and ends in heartbreak. Already as a child, I tended to hide in my shell and isolate myself from others, and every time where I have dared to come out and allowed myself to care for something and show a little vulnerability, it only resulted in pain and reinforced my tendency to just disconnect. I have never found love, I long for it, and at this rate I'm starting to think I will never find it.

I've given a lot of thought to suicide, but I don't think I'll ever do it like you see in movies where everything is so meticulously planned. If I think about it long enough, even if I really want to give up all hope, I know I'll find a way to rationalize not doing it. What I'm afraid of is impulse. Sometimes the pain just becomes to much to bear, and I impulsively desire to destroy myself. I had this feeling a few times, I never went through with it, but I felt I was close as fuck to actually do it. I'm really afraid one day soon, I'll have this urge to die again and this time it's going to be just enough to push me over the edge.

I want to love and care for another. I know deep down I am able to. I know for a fact it would give my life some form of meaning. But I feel so alien compared to others. I never feel I can establish a real connection to anyone. Maybe I'm just incapable of contributing value to the lives of others... The solitude is driving me insane. Every human needs to feel connected... Without wanting to sound like some entitled ""incel"", I think I deserve love too. I never understood what I did wrong to not deserve it. The sadness gets unbearable at times.  ",2.0

I've attempted suicide multiple times, although I wasn't sure if they were ever going to be feasible and they weren't. I've been researching suicide on and off for the past year. I've figured out a lot of things that are and aren't possible. I've had two voluntary periods in the inpatient unit at the hospital for being suicidal. Tomorrow morning I'm going to go look at some train tracks. I'm going to study what happens and see if I could kill myself. I'm going to figure out where to place my head and then come back and study online about the train. Then if I'm able to make it happen, I'm going to do it on Friday.

"MourningTwo weeks ago I met a girl at a small get-together at a friends house.  Our boyfriends were talking shop, and we hit it off, chatting for a couple hours.  She had the most vibrant, cheerful spirit of anyone I've met in ages.  This girl radiated happiness and positive energy, but not in an affected way -- she was truly genuine.  She drew my introverted self out and made me feel comfortable in a group of people I didn't know very well.  She told me to find her on facebook so we could swap recipes, etc.  I've been super busy with work the last couple weeks and didn't follow up. 

Today my boyfriend found out that she hung herself 3 days ago.  There was no note.  Everyone is stunned.

"The EndI think I’m gonna do it tomorrow when I get off of school. I’ll walk to the bridge that’s by my school and be finished. I’ve done all I can do. I’ve begged God not to send me to hell, but I guess f he does I’ll understand. Or maybe I’ll just walk. Go lay in a field somewhere and just do I don’t know what. I’d have to hide so I’m not found. I get it. No one likes me and I’m done. No one believes the beings are real. I’m always getting scolded for talking to them, but at the end of the day, I believe they are real. People only want my mind. My feelings, my beliefs, nothing else matters. Just school, homework, don’t talk to the beings or you’ll destroy your fucking mind. It’s not worth it. Living. I don’t want to be killed but I suppose that might get me out of hell. My mom said I like being sick and that’s why I talk to the beings. But I think they’re real and I want to talk to them. She just said that to hurt me I think. That’s okay. I want this nightmare to be over. My life is a fucking nightmare. And the kicker is that it could be worse. It could always be worse. I don’t understand how all of these people are okay with living in this world. I want out. I doubt God will just kill me in my sleep. One can hope I guess. Tomorrow I have to do something. I can’t tell anyone or they’ll tell my mom who will be undoubtedly pissed that I could ever think of telling anyone how shitty I feel. Maybe they’d talk me out of feeling this way. Maybe they’d know exactly what to say. I’ll never know. I’ll probably get too scared to do anything. Maybe not.

TLDR; The beings are real, everyone hates me, life is too hard, people only care about my intelligence, I’m going to just walk away or kill myself tomorrow.

"I just don't want my friends and family to be sadEarlier today I decided I wanted to take my own life. I had planned to take the full bottle of xanax I had lying around with some old norcos and drink a handle of whiskey and slowly see if I could keep my eyes open. I wrote a letter telling certain people I loved that it wasn't their fault and I'm sorry.

I've just become so unhappy with the person I've become. I am so selfish and lack any sense of self-control and it's been a huge burden on the ones I've loved. I don't want to keep doing that to them. I don't want them to have to worry about me or put aside time to comfort me or give me someone to talk to. I know I've disappointed and hurt them at times and I can't bare to be that person anymore. 

Its hard knowing that my family and close friends might blame themselves and I just want them to be okay with this. I want so badly to let them know that this isn't their fault and they did their best. I want them to remember me as their friend, their brother, their son that was always happy-go-lucky and used humor as a coping mechanism. That I tried my best to be a good person and do the right thing. That I just wanted to make people happy and help those around me. I don't want them to remember this part of me. I don't want them to be sad and dwell on what they could have done or if they did something wrong. It was my own fault, not theirs

"A snowball of stress is starting to crush meFor some background, I live in the  United States and am in my 12th grade, Senior in High School. I have been accepted into a local university but it feels like I can't get there.

I passed my first semester with the lowest grades I've ever gotten, and so far this semester I have multiple D's and F's. I don't know why but my drive to do things is nonexistent. I have missed so much school being sick or pretending to be sick, because i am too afraid to face the truth. My parents don't know about how I'm doing in school, and I even used inspect element to 'edit' my grades shown on the internet. Because of all the school I am missing it just keeps getting worse and worse.

It feels really stupid to be suicidal just based on what I've explained, but the thought just keeps popping into my head the thing is I don't know if I would be able to actually go through with it... It's not just a lingering thought as I also think of methods on how to do it. I'm too scared to tell my parents but I don't think I can catch up on my own... I also don't know if starting to recover in school will help.

I take ProZac daily (prescribed) so I think i should up my dosage after consulting a doctor. I just don't know how to start climbing this mountain and it seems hopeless. I feel like i've failed myself, my family, and my teachers.

"For the first time, I have a life I can fuck upI'm 18 and have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder for two years now. I've been drinking too much for six years, and have spent most of my youth distancing myself from everything and everyone. 

For the first time since I can remember I have someone I'm in love with, I'm close to my family and my recovery seems to be getting closer. Still, I'm more miserable than I've ever been. I can't deal with having a life I could easily fuck up. 

Recently I've been going in and out of severe mania. I found a guy online who was willing to meet in a dark field, in the middle of the night, and made out with him just to feel something. I've been drinking nonstop and taken an excess of medication to see if it would kill me by accident. 

I want to fuck up my life, so I have nothing left and kill myself thereafter. 

I can't deal with living my life anymore. No matter how happy I seem, I feel like I'm rotting inside. It all just seems so pointless. 

I'm tired.

"If i were to seek help, would i lose what freedom i have left?I have considered seeking help, but my mind tells me that admitting to any sort of suicidal thoughts will cause me to be cuffed to a bed in a hospital; drugged, and having no more opportunities for freedom or control over my own life.

"My step father is repeatedly telling me that he's going to divorce my mother because of him having to provide for me. I feel like suicide is the only option as I can't support her or myself.I suffer from severe depression and anxiety among other problems that I'd rather not go into detail about that prevents me from functioning in nearly any social circumstance, and my family has been in poverty for a long time. I've tried to get a job several times only to not be considered after an interview on the phone or otherwise.

Understandably, my parents and step dad find this hard to bear. My mom is sad over my condition but handles it. The fact of that matter is that, I'm a leech. On society, but mostly for my parents which work to support me.

Recently, my step-dad has been threatening me, personally, with divorce (divorcing my mom, so to speak).

He makes it expressly clear that it is MY fault, and my fault alone. While my mom is less confrontational, she's essentially said similar things to me i.e. ""Me and X will divorce only because of you""

I've had suicidal thoughts for a long time now, but have always been grounded by the belief that there were people around me who loved me.

Except now everyobdy is sick. My dad is threatening to leave my Mom because of me, ruining her financially for the rest of her life, putting her in a cardboard box hungry on the streets of some city as a homeless 60 year old woman, my girlfriend routinely reminds me that she hates me and wants me to die, my Mom cries and has stress induced back pain every night. I can hear her crying through the wall.

I am causing their lives to fall apart. And I don't know what do. ""Get a job"", ""Put soem effort into it"", ""Fix your life"". Well drugs aren't fixing it, motivation isn't fixing it, discipline isn't fixing it.

I have no drive, I have no use, I make life worse for everybody around me, and I'm a leech financially. 

I just want to die. It's not selfish anymore. IT's not petty. If I die now, I can break my Moms heart, but I can save her financial future. A mentally broken hobo is worse than a heartbroken woman that is being provided her. A girl with baggage is better than a girl who is with somebody she despises. A guy is better off working one job instead of two to support a disabled fuckwit.

I'm just desperately hoping for a branch to fall onto.

I don't want consoling words...I want a way out...and I think there's only one here. I can't handle the sight of everybody I know having their life fall apart because I can't push myself to lift a finger.",2.0
"DesperateAfter fighting depressing and suicidal thoughts for years, I've started to break. Its exhausting trying to look okay and trying to force myself to feel okay. I've gone almost numb, which is terrifying. I want to get better, but I can't see it getting better. I've been getting worse, cutting my wrist to the point where I'm just ripping open old scabs and scars. I've gotten rid of my razors, giving them to friends so they can get rid of them and also keep an eye in me, but I'm giving up. 

I've started starving myself, not eating so that I can lose weight to be skinnier, even though I know that 110 lbs isn't healthy for a 5'5"" teenage girl. 

Years of being told I'm not good enough, not smart enough, or not pretty enough by my older sister is killing me. Its been so ingrained into my mind that I'm worthless and don't deserve anything good have made compliments feel like absolute lies. I feel worse about myself after. Being ignored, resented and verbally abused by someone you're supposed to look up to breaks you faster than anything else. 

I'm the 'loud, happy and positive' one of my friends, but I'm really not. I don't want to let them down. I don't want to let my friends who've helped keep me alive for so long down, but I know I'm going to. I know how disappointed my friend is evrytime I give him more razors, every time he checks my wrist. I know they're getting sick of me being so pessimistic about myself and refuting their compliments. I know they're getting tired if dealing with me, they have better things to be doing. 
I'm only a sophomore in high school, but I don't want to go on. I don't have the motivation to study, to do well on my exams, to actually try. I know I won't be able to get into a good college with Bs, and I only look worse due to my sisters academic success.

"I've screwed myself over..I've always hated school. Its never been my thing. I've never been interested in learning things I don't need. I've always had trouble with doing homework, which would ultimately ruin my grades and disappoint my parents. Recently I thought of a way to make school easier, I decided I'd go homeschool. My reasoning was because I could get away with doing a lot at once, and then having some free time and repeating this. I didn't have a lot of friends anyways at my other school, so I figured I'd be fine. 

Fast forward about a month, and everything is going amazing, its going the way I planned and I'm even ahead. At the point, I figured I'd just finish that unit and have the time to start working on one of the many things I've wanted to do, write music. I got way to into writing and being creative time passed by and before I realized it, I was half way into the unit and I hadn't started. I had just started a new song and I knew exactly how it was going to sound, but I knew I had to get to work with school, so I lost the song. I felt a little depressed knowing I lost a good song because of school. So then I finished the unit early again and started trying to get my creativity flowing again. It didn't happen so I gave up with music and just played video games. I played video games too much though. 

Soon after this, my friend's mom passes away. I've known her since 4th grade and we were close because of her sons passing the following year. So I didn't know exactly how to feel, except I knew I wanted to go to the memorial. My own mom told me she would let me know when she's heard something about it. A couple weeks later, she tells me, like 3 days before the service. She did say that she knew for about a week and I was suspicious, but I had my mind set on going to the service being held. I thought about it more later, and I thought my mom didn't want me to go. Eventually I asked her and she denied it, and then I felt terrible for not being trusting of my own mom. 

Fast forward again through today. My mom calls and schedules an appointment with the director of my school for today. I check to see where I am, I'm two units behind. Two units. And the appointment was today. I started to panic and freak out, hyperventilate, and almost pass out in my room. But then luckily my mom realized my dad was supposed to get a package today and she rescheduled it for Friday. 

Now I have two days. I'm screwed. It's all my fault. I don't know what to do. I don't want to let my parents down again and have to face them. ",2.0

"The Emmengard Suicide ScaleHey friends,

I recently came across The Emmengard Suicide Scale. Emmengard is a website dedicated to Dissociative Identity Disorder, which I don't have, but I found their Suicide Scale helpful in helping me monitor my own feelings of suicide (I've sat around an 8 for as long as I can remember).

I hope this post doesn't get deleted, and helps you all in knowing when to ask for help.

In middle school, I was told that it gets better in high school. Here is a list of things that happened to me during high school:

\- I was raped by 2 different people

\- A police officer shot me in the leg for ""looking suspicious""

\- My teachers actively avoided speaking to me

\- One teacher went as far as to say ""You are honestly a waste of oxygen"" in front of our class. Everyone laughed.

\- Every one of my peers ignored me, leaving me alone at all times. I had no friends.

Then I was told things would get better in college. Here is what has happened to me (so far) during college:

\- I was raped AGAIN

\- I was told I didn't belong in a club that was open to all students

\- My professors still ignore me

\- One professor called me an idiot for not understanding concepts for their class

\- The theater community here (I am a theater minor, and yes, I know it's a useless degree) has told me that I am ""ruining their overall appearance as a community""

\- Today, a TA called me an ""annoyance"" for asking him questions during his office hours

&amp;#x200B;

THEN people would tell me ""at least you have a good home."" Here is what has happened in my home:

\- My mom admitted to me that the only reason she had me was because she wanted a girl, then she said that I was a ""disappointment from the start""

\- My parents told me that I wasn't bi, I just ""hadn't experienced a woman yet""

\- The one pet I was allowed to own was a guinea pig, it contracted something that made its back legs stop working within the first 2 weeks. My parents killed it and never took it to the vet

"My friend broke our anti-suicide pact. Do I have the right to be mad?Hi,

This morning, my friend informed me through a group chat with my other friends that they were “coming down off a semi-suicide attempt”. This upset me as, a few months ago, they talked me away from my suicidal thoughts and suggested we enter a no-suicide pact.

Yesterday, I reached out to them because they suggested that they were feeling suicidal in a post on social media. I suggested we talk it about it. I asked when they would be available to talk. They continued texting me and making social media post as normal. I texted them again and asked how they were doing. They continued to act normally. I stopped trying and hoped they were fine. It was clear they didn’t want to talk it out.

Flash forward to this morning, they admitted to carrying out a “semi-suicide attempt”. I got mad. I texted them to remind them about our pact and stated that since it didn’t do anything, I was considering it null and void.

I don’t want to be an asshole, but when I thought about killing myself, I always thought about how that wouldn’t be honoring my friend and I’s agreement. I feel a bit cheated and useless. I’m not sure if I have a right to feel anything. I just do.

"I've failed at everything lately, meds ruined me even moreCurrently I'm on sick leave due to not properly functioning. Meds for anxety and depression havent made much effect - only side effects.

Right now im on terrible negative mind set where I failed everything.

Due to meds/or side effects or i dont know what else i barely walked 1 kilomere. I wanted to go to my doc because i felt like i was about to pass out and die. 
I cant even work, going to grocery store is painful hard and dizzy.

Every last trip i had was terrible i cannot function Like normal human beign.

"Give me one reason to keep existing""Because people will miss you!""

I don't fucking care if people miss me. I'm a fucking asshole who probably wouldn't care if they all died. I just mooch of them anyway so I'd only be sad that I lost shit when they're dead. They don't matter to me anyway.

I've nothing to offer the world and my loved ones are slowly leaving me due to disappointment. I'm just gonna end up a worthless NEET taking from the world and offering nothing back.

Even by asking for help I'm wasting time that could be going to other people. If I kill myself now I'll never have anyone hurt by me again. I only hurt and take from people, I shouldn't exist.",2.0

"I'm so tired.As the title suggests, I'm very tired of everything. First, some backstory. I'm eighteen years old, and have been struggling with depression since I was fifteen. I never told anyone about it, always thinking that it was nothing. But I was wrong. I had a happy upbringing, no abuse, great parents, always got the things I needed or wanted, etc. But it feels like that doesn't matter anymore. It feels like all joy is just sapped of me; and I'm never permanently saddened. It's temporary, and it's like I'm on a rollercoaster of emotions, going from the highest of highs, to the most crippling of lows. I've never made a suicide attempt for my life before, but I'm really considering it. 

About a month ago, I was given an entry level separation from the military, due to my psychological status not being satisfactory for military service. Needless to say, when I was transported to a psyche ward and told that the chances of me rejoining were slim to none. I cried a lot, and really wondered what the hell I was going to do. Thankfully, the psyche ward had this phone room, and they pretty much allowed everyone there to use it freely. I talked to my mom, and she said everything was going to be alright, and that when I get home, we'd find myself a job, and I'd go to college at some technical school for computer science. But, it feels like there's no point.

I just don't have any motivation to do anything anymore. I don't get it; I really don't. Everyone says they love and value me, but do they really? Because they never say a damn thing to me until I say something or something happens. It really doesn't help that people who are 'supporting' me are practically not helping at all. I just want it all to go away. Everything. I just want to disappear permanently. I feel like I'm a fucking failure at everything I do, like I'm destined to fail to live up to my older siblings, who both have successful careers. 

When I tell people why I'm home from the military, they just look at me like I'm some kind of freak. They don't have a clue just how difficult it is for me to even get the motivation to get out of bed some days. My friends do the same thing too, and I don't have many of those either. It feels like everything is falling apart.

"getting ready to live a garbage, miserable life all because my face is repulsiveOkay i'll first start with this post by saying i'm very ugly for a guy. No this is not an exaggeration or body dysmorphia, i've just been able to gauge and put together all the pieces that my face is repulsive to both men and women. I'm a 2.5/10. I can already guess what your thinking: ""A fat guy in his basement who likes anime, lose some weight you'll look better"". That's as far from the truth as possible. I'm a very skinny 18 year old Australian guy. My face is lopsided, my hairline starts abnormally high so it looks like i'm balding and my jaw, chin and cheeks are all recessed back to some degree. Now before you write how women like men based on confidence and personality, just remember it's not that hard for an average guy or higher to pull this off, to be confident and get a girl based on that. The concept of being grotesque is a foreign experience for about 70% of people. It's difficult for a lot of people to understand what it's like to truly be ugly. Of course my parents are delusional about this because it's extremely difficult to accept that your child is a genetic failure. Some people might say being ugly is a good thing because you don't have to live your life by your looks but this is utter rubbish. It's the same as telling a really short guy not to live his life by his height. He will have to because people will remind him how short he is and mock him based on it. I wish I was average looking so badly, where I could go out in public and not be given the stink eye for fucking existing. I've wanted to die just about every day since I was 15. I'm saving up for plastic surgery to help improve my situation. There's no way they can make my face look any fucking worse so I've got nothing to lose. Hopefully this makes you feel better knowing that at least your better looking than some subhuman who will live the most miserable life possible in the supposed ""best country to live in"".",2.0

I show no promise in my life. I'm twenty years old and I've never even had friends or a serious relationship. I know people don't like having me around. Whenever I come home from my school, my family makes it a point to tell me I'm a burden, that I get in the way, I annoy them, etc. 

I feel like a mirror image of a person. Backwards. An illusion. If you reached out and touched me, you would cold, hard, glass.

I don't really want to die. But I don't have any other choice. I'm out of options and nobody wants me around anyways. Dying is the single most altruistic thing I can do.  I've already chosen a method and started writing my note. I hope whoever finds my body can forgive me for the trouble I cause.",2.0

"so i finally got tired of being anxious and depressed, crying daily, not leaving the house a few months ago and decided it was time to see a doctor again. I would only leave to work, and couldnt hold a job very long due to the anxiety(eventually stop going after successfully alienating myself from everyone) and went to see a psychiatrist. He started me on 40mg of fluoxetine and 50mg atenolol a day with 1mg lorazepam 3x daily as needed. I averaged about 2 of the lorazepam a day, some days 3 some days 1 or even 0, and 1 time i took 4(christmas with the family, not all at once but over the course of the evening) I went back after about 2 and a half months and he increased my atenolol to 100mg and switched me to .5mg alprazolam 1x a day(from the past i knew this wouldnt be an effective dose but he wouldnt listen) For the 2 and a half months i felt like i was leading a normal life, doing well in school, seeing friends again, working, going on dates(have a girlfriend who understands my anxiety and we met when  i was drinking to deal with it so this is the worst shes ever seen me and wants me to find a new doctor) interacting with my family and not hiding in my room all day. With the switch to xanax ive gone back to my old ways of hiding away, crying, not eating, and have almsot purchased cigarettes again(quit smoking about 10 months ago).",1.0

I told my husband and therapist that if I don't feel better within a year, I am definitely going to end it. No f***ing around with the ""cry for help"" kinda ODing nonsense.

I plan on doing whatever they tell me until then to try to get better. But at this point, I doubt anything will help.

"Life isn't worth itIn one side I have


Pain
Suffering
Never ending depression
Fragile physical health
Poor mental health
Need of daily medicines
Unable to work properly due to my condition
Too old to have no accomplishments like I do
Hate a lot of mundane stuff 
Dislike most people I meet
Loneliness
Constant Sadness
No friends
No relationship works out for me



In the other side I have


A good family
Good looks
Family's money
My pets

The good things just aren't worth the bad ones.
For every good thing on life there are a lot of bad ones.
Nothing works out for me and I'll be 25 this year.
I don't love life, I don't enjoy living, I just poorly survive everyday trying to fill holes with superficial stuff like games or food.
But even games became boring and I have nausea and no appetite most time.
Nothing is enjoyable anymore.
I have a nice work but the pain and constant struggle make me do it poorly, making people see me as a lazy or slow girl.
Today I worked without any words because I had tears in my throat all the time.
Any speaking would make me overflow in front of everyone.
My eyes were red all the time.
This has been going on for more than 10 years and no matter how much I see doctors, therapists, take a hundred different pills, pills that made me fat, skinny, sleepy, it doesn't go away, it never does, it never will.
Life has no enjoyment for me.
The price I have to pay for enjoying it is too expensive.

I wish I could be healthy, different, happy, energetic.
I dont like this life.
But I've tried everything and I can't leave this hole, for every centimeter I climb up, a strong gravity like force pulls me meters down again.
When I thought I was reaching the bottom it turned out to be deeper and endless.

I want to cry, scream, someone please take me out from here, take me back to the surface.
But no one has the power to do it, for I am way too heavy even to stand up by myself.

Now I just need to choose the method.

"No HopeHey there, who ever you are !
After many chronic illnesses and one failed suicid attempt, I’m trying it again with a different method.
Fentanyl, Oxycodon, Tilidin and heating blanket.

I really hope that I slip into unconsciousness soon and die peacefully. 
Could have drunken some alc. but the taste was just to much for me .

For everyone:
We all know that life is ducking hard, but if you have the opportunity to change your life - DO IT
Run away, find a new job, take a long vacation - change your life while you can so that you don’t regret your missed opportunities on your deathbed .
There are always changes in life, make the best out of those situations.

Live is for most people cruel and painful in soo many ways - change thinks you could change 

Everyone is different and has different circumstances.
I believe that everyone should have the right (with professional help) to end his own life.

I dont know. I have my dream job but every day all I can think about is killing myself. I call my friends and talk for hours but when I hang up I just feel lonely.

What's the point? It's all downhill from here. I have diagnosed depression but I cant get medicated because of my crippling health anxiety. I faint when I walk into the doctors office. Everyone laughs at me and tells me to grow up. 

My parents hate me I'm sure I'm just a burden. They might be sad for a day but then they'd be happy. My best friend wants to kill herself, I've been keeping her alive talking to her. But I feel like shit. Because I'm making to her all the false promises that were made to me. I tell her tommorow will be better. But it's not. It will never be better. At this point its cruel, we are both miserable. Wed both be happier dead.

The only thing that keeps me alive is my health anxiety. If my attempt failed and I rushed to the hospital, that's my worst fear. I dont have any hope. I've tried everything , but I've been miserable my whole life. Every single photo of me as a child or teen I am crying.

Ever since I started grade 9 my life went down hill. I'm white and brown. My dad has no back bone and let's my mother talk abuse shit to me any second she can get. No matter what I say in any conversation it because something negative to me. I've become suicidal and depressed since Grade 11 (I'm in Grade 12) as well I have anxiety attacks due to having stressed induced anxiety attacks. My parent's are Christian extremists who simply said ""pray"" it away. My parents never say I love you or anything anymore. I had shitty grade most of my life and I decided to pick them up. I went from 50's to 70's and 80's and I have only one 41. All my parents could say were how bad I am at school and that I'll never amount to anything. I'm tired  of everything. I have friends I'm not a loner I'm quite the extrovert. My life was at a point where I felt on top of the world. I had a job and I didn't have to see my parents at all because of it so I was happy. I'm a pathological liar and they know this. I can't quit lying I feel there is a necessity to lie to my parents because of how they blow everything out of proportion yet they claim I can tell them anything and when I have it ends up terribly. I smoke weed and I've been keeping it from them for a year or two now. They are slowly catching on. I smoke weed because it genuinely makes me not want to kill myself. 

When I told my parents about me being suicidal and having depression they made it about themselves and blamed said I was lying because mid terms were a week away and I didn't want them to be mad at my grades. I didn't intend on that at all. They made the situation about school and started calling me shitty names etc. I went to school the next day and my counselor whom I told first about it was baffled. I'm simply tired of not feeling loved by my parents. I want to move out but there's no place to move out to. My relatives won't take me in because they don't want problems with my parents. My grades started to slip because I simply have no motivation for anything anymore. I want to simply commit suicide but I'm afraid of the after life. Whether it be hell or complete nothingness.

"Need help with your suggestionsMy wife is abusive and I’m separated from her by living in a different city. Thanks to lockdown and travel restriction, I’ve been living peacefully for last few months. 

Now that the restrictions are being lifted, my wife wants to come back and is threatening and abusing me over the phone. Her parents have also joined in threatening and harassing me. They are threatening to kill me if I file for a divorce. 

Due to the stress, I suffer from autoimmune condition so I’m weak physically as I’ve been losing weight and overall I’m not in my best health. I also lost a job recently but I’m not worried about it as I received some severance and I’ve over 8 years of expenses as savings. I can also find another job maybe in 3-4 months as I’ve interviews lined up. 

I’m Super stressed about my marriage and often think of suicide to get away with it. I also thought of running away to a foreign country and live discretely for few years. I was very depressed in Feb and was contemplating suicide but the lockdown/restrictions helped me live peacefully. I also happen to get into a FWB who was nice and helped me a lot. I know there’s a bright side to life but I’m getting nightmares that I’d be killed sooner or later by my wife or father in law. 

I’d preferred flying to some place in Europe but my only worry is they’d harass my elderly parents. 

I’m in India and unfortunately the law/police don’t help.

I lost my grandma, an uncle, a few girlfriends, a really important scholarship, the emotional intimacy I used to have with my current girlfriend, and I might lose my best friend to surgery complications soon.

I think at this point the only thing keeping me from suicide is practicality. I don't want to shoot myself in the head because I don't want my mom to have to see that. I could shoot myself in the chest and hope that I hit my heart, but my shotgun is too long for me to be able to pull the trigger at that angle. 

But I'm digressing, do y'all have any success stories about what happened when you didn't pull the trigger? I don't know what I'm going to do with my life if I don't kill myself, and some inspiration about what to do would be really nice.",2.0

So I have ptsd from an abusive relationship I ended about 3 years ago. When I felt healthy enough I went to therapy and did emdr and it helped and I thought i was doing well. I even moved to a different state so I could quit triggering my flashbacks a year and a half ago and haven't had a single flashback until last night. I have started dating a guy I'm pretty smitten about and last night we went out with friends and had a really good time but we also had been drinking. Something triggered me and i had a flashback and was not able to control my emotions because I had been drinking it was like I went from laughing having a good time to having a panic attack and asked him if we could leave and we did.,1.0

"I have a friend who is going through hard times and keeps talking about wanting to commit suicide. What can I do?I have a friend and co-worker who is going though very tough financial and marriage issues at the moment, and she keeps talking about her desire to commit suicide.  Long story short, Her husband lost his job and company car back in July.  She is now the sole earner in her family and is trying to support her Husband and 2 children on her salary, which is not that good.  In addition to working her regular 8-5pm job, to make ends meet, she also works as call operator for our company every evening and night.  So she has essentially been working around the clock since July.  Her husband has not been proactive about getting a new job and he has sort of ""checked out"" in helping around the house.  She says he refuses  to help clean, or cook, or do much of the ""home-maker"" duties while she is at work during the day and waits for her to come home and cook and do the laundry etc.  She says she feels, trapped and suffocating and is not sure how much longer she can last.  Her son also needs special ADHD treatment and behavioural counsuling which she cannot afford since her Husabnd lost his job.  So yeah, she is having some hard times.  She has attempted suicide in the past and her Brother committed slow suicide from Alcohol abuse.  I want to be able to help her, but honestly, I have no idea what to do.  I help her out by driving her back and forth from work since we live near each other so her husband can use the car to look for work or run errands, but I think she needs to talk to someone, a professional.  I don't think my advice is helping, or even qualifies as help.  I am honestly worried.",2.0

How can I move on without ever coming to know if my worries about the past and my thoughts are true or not. I just want certainty, but I know I will never get that. It's unbearable. I can't just ""move on"" from it, since there is always the doubt in the back of my head. At this point it has taken over my life. My therapist keeps telling me I need distraction, but whatever I do the thoughts, doubts, obsessions, remorse and guilt are on the foreground of my mind. I don't WANT distraction.

So eventually there will be a point where I'll snap, drop out, can't find a job and will be institutionalized to live the rest of my life suffering, making my loved ones, especially my parents, feel horrible as well.

"Quarantine brought back my depressionHi guys,

for the past 6 months my social life has been kinda working. But now my country is in lockdown and i realised the people i considered ""friends"" dont give a shit about me. 

I have been locked in my apartment for 8 days now, my last suicide attempt was a year ago and i can sense how that feeling is coming back.

I don't know for how long i can take it anymore.

I hope this day ends soon, because there is nothing to be awake for. Maybe this emptiness is just a apet of me and i should go to sleep forever.

Ok thanks for listening i know you don't care.

Love,

"But recently I went on a car journey with my friends and 5 minutes before we got to the destination I started panicking because I thought I needed a wee and took a valium (completely embarrassed myself in-front of my friends). once we got to the destination I was actually fine and didn't really need one that bad. Since then it keeps happening, like I was on the train and 1 stop before my destination I got off and walked because I started panicking. then today really got to me because I needed to get a bus that goes through a tunnel to go to the pub that takes 10 mins and I physically couldn't get on the bus because of this fear.

"I know the best thing for me is to find a new job, but I've been applying for quite awhile now with no luck and I really don't want to move to another job that I don't enjoy and will make me feel the exact same way. I sort of think I have an idea of what I want to do, but I have no idea how to make it happen while still paying my bills so I've been applying to anything that seems like it might be relevant to me, but I'm not sure the right way to go about getting into a field I don't have a degree in. Because of this I feel trapped in my job right now and it gets so bad some days where I feel like just walking out and quitting or just not going in ever again. I'm rambling at this point, does anyone else deal with a job that makes them completely miserable? How do you deal with it?",1.0

"Struggling for so long and never able to ventI loathe that I am so hopelessly unhappy that I want to die and that, like a cruel joke, if I tell anyone how low I am I am ostracized, berated, guilt tripped with ""how selfish I am"", and met with no empathy. The world keeps selfishly saying ""don't want to die or you're a piece of shit coward"" and miraculously wonders why depressed people don't reach out.
I've talked to friends ""just stop being depressed dude""
I've talked therapists for years ""take lots of drugs and if you admit you're super depressed we will ruin your life and flag you as a dangerous person""
So there's no one to talk to. Talking literally makes it worse it seems. The only reason, besides fear of going to hell, that I haven't killed myself is because I know my mom would die from grief. And now my mom managed to get diagnosed with cancer, bit by a tick and get Lyme disease, and get bit by a brown recluse spider all in one day. 
Considering I am recovering from breaking my legs and arm and feet from an accident and I still can't recover from my partner of 5 years telling me to go kill myself I just don't think I can hold on much longer. I can't help but see this life as a sick comedy with how terrible it is. ""Laugh and the world laughs with you. Cry and you cry alone""

I guess I just wanted to rant and talk to myself. Sorry to bother or annoy anyone. ",2.0

"TiredI’m 19yr college student, I live in a shitty area in the north east. I feel like online school took out the structure from my life and everything kinda fell apart. I’ve always had issues finding motivation for things but was I guess it was held together by the social norm. Now that no one is seeing me go to class and encouraging me to keep going and trying hard in class everything has crumbled. I feel like a piece of shit because I see stuff that people go through and how strong they stay and what I’m going through is nothing compared to that but I can’t help the feeling. I know how much my family loves me so I can't kill myself but it’s the only thing I think about. All I do is try to distract myself from the impending doom that my life is now inevitably headed towards. I try to distract it with drugs and partying and drinking and I do feel happy sometimes but when it comes down too it all I want to do is just walk off a building and end the menial bullshit that I’m gonna have to live with for the rest of my life. I don’t want to do this anymore. What should I do? I have been contemplating the military but I’m not sure if that would be off the table if I went to a shrink or some shit. I’m also scared of the image I might receive if I tell someone how I feel and I don’t want to be the black sheep of my family. Seems like no matter where I go the outcome is shitty. Whatever idk what I’m even looking for at this point. All I have is supportive figures in my life and I’m sure they would be very supportive but I know how it is to be on the other side of that and I don’t want to be that burden. I don’t want to keep going I’m losing any motivation to persevere everyday. I hear and see people going through horrible shit was worse than me and I just feel like a pussy because I can barely handle daily life. Yet when it comes to it I have nothing personally to live for and I feel like shit 24/7. Feel like a doll being held up by strings and the only one left is my family. The expectations set for me are so high that I feel like no matter what I can’t reach it. Not sure what I’m looking for here maybe some advice, maybe being assured I’m not alone and this pandemic is fucking others too. I’d like help but I’m not sure how they could even do that lol since I’m broke as shit and probably couldn’t pay for it. Whatever this is making me feel even worse. Thanks for everything luv u",2.0

"I definitely feel like it's an optionTo copy and paste my thoughts raw:

&gt;I feel that I'm absolutely going to be able to go nowhere in my life right now (even though I'm eighteen, shouldn't it be true that my rights as a person and what I should be doing in order to get what I need shouldn't change anyway?)
Knowing that my parents definitely treat each other like garbage and have physically and have verbally been violent towards each other in the past, I can't expect that they are going to be alive for long enough to support me financially and emotionally but also that I cannot feel obligated to take from a separate government/family if the people who were directly responsible for my life don't have the capability to look after it anymore.
I suppose what this means for me now is to just rot financially and physically or immediately commit suicide if I want to immediately not be a burden to anyone that I have previously supported. I don't want to do anything else in my initiative to contribute if it means that potentially my parents and people around me who support me will get agitated and attack each other just like my parents did.

I don't think I know what to do and what options I am allowed to have.. but this is for those who want to read me anyway.

thank you

*I want to add some more:*

I feel like it's also disrespectful to look for others to support me in my journey because no one deserves to have to support someone out of their family and take time out of their busy lives. In the end, all I tried to do was work or study while not being immediately detrimental in the system I was working in, and I guessed I was being detrimental to the system in that people inside this system had to support so far while I knew that I wasn't going to focus on being far enough.

"26/WOC I NEED A REASON TO LIVEI have made 2 attempts since I was 15 and have been suicidal on and off. I don’t believe I’m fearless enough to go through with it but I think about dying a lot. I always pretend to be happy and listen to other people but I’m hurting inside for so many reasons. No one knows I’m hurting. I don’t think anyone knows me and all of the things I have done and been through. I want to heal and never thought I would really become more bitter and hurt.

I want a relationship but I don’t feel like I have ever been loved before. My father was a mess and had anger issues. My mother was physically and mentally abusive and I lived with her in a farmland area so I have a lot of direct personal trauma. School was my escape. Then I became homeless for a while and it has been hard to finish. I feel like a failure in life like people laughed at me for failing when I was trying so hard. I don’t ever tell anyone about this but who would care?

“You have to have a boyfriend” I am damaged and afraid to be myself or open up because they don’t care. I know in today’s world I’ll never find someone that will understand me without judgement. I can’t even imagine anyone with that amount of kindness in their heart to be a good person. People come and go while I pretend I’m okay.I have a problem and I wish the pain would stop.

Now I have an okay job. I do my job. They offer resources that keep my mind balanced so I wanted to get pregnant and have a happy baby that will love me for who I am. 

I know it’s not the best decision but I think it would give me a higher purpose to live.",2.0

I've had an anxiety disorder since I was 6, but lately it's gotten so bad that I can't make it to class, I can't take a bus, I can't go out and see my partner or my friends or go to the grocery store. I had to move back in with my parents and I'm about to drop out of school. I can rarely go a day without having a panic attack, and I often end up on the floor screaming and completely freaking out until someone calls an ambulance. I have done virtually everything I can do, I've gone to therapy, seen counselors and therapists, taken almost every medication, tried all the ""self-help"" stuff, and none of it is working. My father is on unemployment now because I can't be left alone. I frequently consider killing myself when I'm having a panic attack because I'm so terrified, and lately I've been thinking about it even when I'm not. I used to be a really happy person, I have plenty of friends and a girlfriend, I was doing good in university and had a lot of plans for what I wanted to do with my life, but now I'm pretty much confined to my house living in unimaginable fear of absolutely nothing at all. I can't control it and I just want to stop being afraid. I don't know what to do.",2.0

I'm 25 years old, graduated from University 3 years ago. When I graduated I immediatly start to look for a job but I always rejected because you need to go Military in my country. 1 month after graduation I learned that my gf was cheating on me, this was the break point in my life. I become suicidal only thing I was able to think was suicide. I didnt wanted to think anything so I go to military but before going to military my dream company called me and asked me if I wanted to work with them i said i cant because i was going to military.

So military service is over i return back to my parents home I kept sending resumes and applying for jobs. One day i found a great job. Interview was really good. After sometime they didnt called me so i called them they said they hired someone. And that someone was my ex gfs boyfriend. My long gone suicidal side was returned again i couldn't stop thinking it. I was failed againts him. This was 1.5 years ago.

Im unemployee since that time. I make myself lonely im not answering anycalls from my friends i blocked them all because they all have good jobs working marrying and stuff, i don't want to face with them i dont want them to see me living a miserable life.

He stayed and raised the child for two years with her, she ditched and my love raised his unwanted child alone for another year. He joins the army and so gets the woman to take back their child.

He tells me this child means nothing to him, he never wanted this child. But it KILLS me that he has a child with another woman, and helped her raise the child initially. It kills me to know that he was stupid and didn't avoid an easily avoidable mistake.

He tells me he never loved her, never truly wanted to be with her, that she was a matter of convenience. 

Is my pain convenient? Was the tens of thousands of dollars you have spent on your unwanted child convenient?

I love him, I want to be with him, but loving him hurts me because I am jealous and upset of his having a child with another woman, albeit an unwanted child on his part.

How can I completely love and respect a man who (unintentionally) hurts me so bad? Unintentional, but easily avoidable.

I've never had a real purpose to live, there really isn't one. I never believed in true love until I met this man. But loving him hurts me.

I've tried so hard to not let his having a child with another woman bother me, but I cry every day. I lost ten pounds in the matter of a week with how distraught I became. I am holding it together better now, but it's still very hard, I don't know how much longer I can try to keep it up.

"Should I worry about my suicidal thoughts or is it just self-pity?I am sorry if this question is dumb but I feel very unsure about this. I often think about suicide.

I have never seriously tried to kill myself. I mean 2 years ago I was so tired of my porn addiction that I went to my balcony and got on the railing(im not sure if thats the word english isnt my first language) and sat there thinking about jumping. I am usually very scared to do things like that but I was just tired. That was one time. A couple of weeks ago I was driving my car and I felt so strong that I should drive into a tree. I felt so much guilt and shame for being a very bad person that I felt that it was better to just end it. I have to be honest I got a little worried. I talked to my therapist and a pshyciatrist and I got some medicin for it. They didnt think I was depressed but that I struggle with some compulsive thoughts.   


Today I realized that I dont know if I will ever get free from this porn addiction. If I am going to do it I have to tell my wife all about it and there is a chance she will leave me. THis made me think about suicide again. If she leaves me and find someone else I would be happy for her but I think about ending it if that happens. I am absolutely not telling her about this. We are good right now but who knows. I usually just think about it but I have noticed that I am not sure that I want to do it. Today I caught myself wanting to come to the place where I really want to do it. I am feeling a lot of anxiety about this and I feel that it would just be a relief from all this feelings of guilt and shame. At the same time I dont know if its just self-pity. That I dont want to be an adult about this situation and instead think about suicide to feel sorry for myself. I am sorryu if this sounds confusing I just feel unsure if I should take this serious.",2.0

"I'm probably leaving within the next few daysHey all,

I'm 25, and have had depression issues for over a decade. 

Recently, i've been experiencing almost constant hallucinations. I live with parents, and live in an upstairs bedroom. I frequently hear my dad calling for me, even when he isn't home. I also keep seeing spiders and other bugs crawling on my arms, when they aren't actually there.

I'm likely about to get turned down for a really good job because of some bullshit with an ex-employer. 

If/when I get turned down, I will have to leave this house. My dad seems to be going through some sort of mental illness where he is losing his memory and is increasingly violent for reasons that don't make sense to anyone else. My best friend's mom recently went through something similar. Police and EMS finally got her sedated enough to be admitted to a home for Alzheimer's/demetia patients. She died a few months later from undiagnosed ovarian cancer.

This is a super rural area. Homelessness isn't a thing here, and I don't have anyone else I can stay with. Best friend is working through losing his house because they got a reverse-mortgage to handle mum's care. The only other friend I know who owns a house would need an exorbitant amount of rent per month, which I obviously couldn't provide without a decent job, which i'm about to get fucked out of.

The only other option is to find a way, within a week, to raise enough money for a plane ticket to the foreign country my fiancee lives in. It costs 3-4 times as much for me to go there as it does for her to come here, so....extremely unlikely. Her country's laws are much nicer than mine, I could go with no visa and stay up to six months, which would be enough time to get a life figured out. 

Instead, i'll likely end up wandering into our woods some night with the 30.06 that is sitting by my door. 

It sucks. One good opportunity for an okay income could've led to a lifetime of happiness for me and my wife to be. I live in the rural midwestern US; if I had enough for a down payment on a house, I could pay the bills working at McDonald's, no joke. 

My parents are millionaires, but regret having kids, so there's no chance of getting financial help from them. Raising kids has already cut into their retirement too much.

All I ask is that someone post me on DeadRedditors if I don't post on next Wednesday. 

I just want to be somewhat remembered, as we all do. 

Thanks, everyone. ",2.0

"Thank youIf it weren't for this community I would be dead. A few years back I was struggling with a litany of problems. I had been dealing with a violent break-up, struggling with depression and medication and I was at the height of my alcoholism. All I wanted to do was die. But somehow I wandered in here, and I told people what I was feeling, and how scared and defeated I felt and what I wanted to do. 

I expected what we all expect from the internet. I expected hundreds to tell me to do it, or worse, only one. Instead, something beautiful happened to me. People I didn't know chose to care about me. They told me stories and offered support and resources that were more useful to me than any that had been offered by hospitals or government that I'd previously forced to interact with. 

Since that time my family has let me come home, I've found and held a stable job and used it to pay for half (so far) of a Bachelors in secondary education which would allow me to pursue my dream of teaching writing to teenagers (watched dead poets society too many times). As well as countless other advantages and leaps that all started from well-meaning people on the internet. 

My life was shit. I was homeless, helpless and hopelessly addicted and I had given up a long time ago. But this place, this place where people care unconditionally because they know exactly what you're talking about, is most definitely the thing that saved my life and allowed me to make it into what it is today. 

Listen to the people here. They love you. I love you. This will turn around and no one should have to die from it. I thought I had to and for the last five years I've never been happier to be wrong.",2.0

I could work out or whatever and go on testosterone, but I wouldn’t actually get the results I would like. And my hips are still growing, meaning I'm fucked. I will never be over 5’5, I will never have smaller hips than I do, my hands and feet will always be too small to be considered male, and I could keep going, but you probably don't care too much about the specifics. I don’t want to be a tranny, I don’t want to be a girl, I don’t have another option. So I feel ending it all would be best.

"I wrote this in my journal and it scares me.Everyone thinks I'm happy and outgoing. I have a lot of friends. I have a boyfriend. I should be. I don’t think anyone knows me. I don’t think anyone knows what is really going on.

I have so many regrets about this life. I feel like I was given a pretty good life (despite having a shitty mom) and I did the worst things with it. I used it up. I let that happen when I was younger. I fucked up school and my career. I was a slut and a whore. I was shitty to my friends. I never did anything important.

A few months ago, I was sleeping in a bed. He was sleeping on the floor. After the wedding. I woke up when he was next to me and touching me, it took me a few minutes to realize what was going on. I tried to stop it but maybe not forcefully enough. I feel stupid because it’s so small but I’ve been so angry and sad since then. I can’t tell anyone and I will never tell anyone. I want to make it not happen. I feel bad for him. I feel bad for myself. I don’t feel like I know what really happened and I don’t really understand it. It feels like it happened to someone else.

Dad died over a month ago. Mom sucks like always. The rest of my family contacts me when they need something from me.

I’m going crazy. There is more and more shit that happens every week. People say I am strong. They don’t really know what I am.

He wanted to know if I wanted to sign up for the team. I'm bi but he knows (relevant later). When I approached him he stood up and shook my hand. Ngl his shirt went up a bit and I saw his abs, (ikr right). I for some reason got excited ( I think that's the feeling) and ran off. When he asked a fellow player a question, the player told my teacher I'm bi. Being the caring and kind teacher he is, he went to my school counselor and asked her to check up on me and see if I'm okay.

But my main principal whom I'm very close to told me this is inappropriate behavior that she shouldn't be exhibiting.

"Called the suicide hotline. That was a mistake.A week ago wife of seven years told me that she hasn't loved me for the last year or so, and asked me for a separation. I was blindsided and, quite frankly, still on shock. The one person I've ever truly loved just doesn't reciprocate, it was a really rough feeling. It is a really rough feeling.

I called the suicide hotline. I'm not entirely sure why. I wasn't particularly suicidal, but I felt like if I didn't talk to SOMEONE about it, I could spiral. I was just really sad and wanted someone to tell me I was going to be okay. So I googled crisis hotline and it was the first thing that stood out to me. 

This apathetic, bored sounding woman asked a bunch of leading questions about suicide. I get it, it's their hotline. But she just kept digging and digging into how I would do it, do I have means, do I think people would miss me, etc. Again, all I wanted was to talk to someone. My whole reality was broken and I wanted someone to tell me I was going to be okay.

I told her that this wasn't what I needed right now, I just wanted to talk to someone so I was going to call my parents instead. And then I hung up. Probably not the smartest call in hindsight to hang up, but I didn't want to talk about killing myself anymore. I wanted my dad.

They called the cops. I had 4 police cars and 7 police officers surrounding me in front of my house. They put me in handcuffs in front of my kids and all of my neighbors, drove me to the hospital against my will, strip searched me like a criminal, and kept me in handcuffs for over two hours while we waited for a doctor to come talk to me and decide I wasn't suicidal.

I understand that suicide is a serious issue. I do. I'm not suicidal right now, just so incredibly sad. But being treated like a criminal in handcuffs and being publicly embarrassed in front of everyone is certainly NOT what I needed in the most traumatic experience of my life.

I hope that the suicide hotline experience isn't the same for everyone, but it certainly left a bad taste in my mouth.",2.0

"I wish i never existedWhat's the whole point of life? I just don't get it. Some idiots say we are special. According to my understanding, every life's value is same. \[For example, an ants life=humans life, only the structure and complexity of working are different\]. Humans are nothing special. Many had died before us and many will die in future, they were humans too, some were considered great in human terms and some were not. But they all died in the end. Most of us live our lives living in fantasy. Not even once bothered to look outside their comfort zones. But as you grow older, our comfort zones will rip itself apart making you to face harsh reality. Some overcome this by using drugs. Some are not lucky enough to not see the real world. Some end their lives as it gets tougher. Some are cowards like me because its scary to die. At the end of the day, it never really matters whether anyone exists or not existed. But i still would prefer the later.

So in order to live in this world. One has to find something he/she desires. Without any desires, Life gets tough, it gets miserable over time. Even having desires is not good enough, you must find the way to achieve your desires. There is no point in hoping. If you want to catch a fish, you have use fishing rod, bait, go in areas where there are more fish and have to wait patiently to get a fish. No fish will comes if you just wait near a lake/pond without doing anything.

Stop hoping life will change magically. If you really want your life to change and achieve what you desire, you have to take the necessary actions to be the change.

I am just probably going through the five stages of death.

The five stages are denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance.

My 11 year old sister has seen the worst of me and some things will never leave her. I should be so grateful to have parents that care about me more than themselves and it kills me to know my mum has sleepless nights over me every night, and it kills me to know what she thinks of me and what she thinks I’ve become. I just feel so lost I have no idea what I what from this world, i basically depend on weed to feel normal, when I don’t smoke I am crippled by anxiety and have bad mood swings. I really know I have to stop smoking and have cut down a lot in the past few weeks therefore I am feelings a lot worse than usual, and my usual has never been good. I really can’t kill myself but that’s all I want to do, or at least I get urges to. 

Thankyou for letting me vent and I hope you all have a great day ",2.0

"I don't want to live another day.You know what? Everyday hurts. It feels like everything that goes wrong outweighs everything that goes right. Everyday, I'm reminded of how worthless and stupid I am. She even told to kill myself once. And I've tried to talking to my friends about how my parents make me feel, but all I get is ""aren't all parents like that lmao"" and it makes me feel like I'm overreacting. It feels like no matter what I say or what I do, I'll just be looked down on as some edgy, rebellious, ungrateful teenager going through a phase. And that makes me feel like shit because it's like saying none of my feelings are valid. Maybe my existence isn't valid. But I'm just tired of living like this. I'm tired of being afraid of saying or doing the wrong thing. It feels like whatever I do, no matter how trivial, will always anger her in some way. I've had a friend who told me to talk to her, because she's still my ""parent"", but fuck, I doubt she'd even listen. Anytime anyone has tried to talk to her about how she's too much of a narcissistic asshole for her own good, she doesn't listen, not even to her own father. She's never going to change. Nothing is going to change. She's just getting worse and worse each day. And I'm trying to stay positive, I'm trying to smile, but it's so hard to do that when everyday is just someone telling you how their life would be better off without you and how they wished you didn't exist. ""Well why don't you just let it all out and cry"", I tried, but every time I cry, all I can remember is the day she beat me for crying after she just yelled and yelled at me for something I couldn't control. It was humiliating. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know if I should do anything anymore. Sometimes, I just want to curl up in a ball and die. Sometimes, I don't want to live another day. Sometimes, I wish I didn't exist in the first place. And I know his all sounds like generic edgy shit but it's so tiring. It's so tiring to say ""I'm okay"" when all you want to do is cry and cut yourself until you bleed to death. I know I'll probably be better tomorrow but this is the lowest I've ever been and the first time I ever wrote a suicide note. I just don't know if I can keep living anymore.",2.0

"Tried (and failed) over dosing a couple days agoI had a lot of emotions going on, my ex kicked me out, told me she loved someone else, and wanted no contact with me. I had nowhere to go,  and no clue what I should’ve done. So I took what money I had and booked myself into a motel. I bought 12 boxes of sleeping aides. I figured if I took them all I would just sleep and not wake back up. All lot of it is a blur, but it didn’t make me fall asleep, it was the complete opposite. It was like I couldn’t tell what was really happening and what was fake. I’m still not positive what all happened. But at some point The manager at the motel got complaints of loud noises coming from my room, another one called saying I fell down some stairs tryin to get to my car. And here is where I only know what the paramedics and nurses told me, cause I don’t remember anything. The manager called the police and they kicked in my door, i was conscious but barely there.  I was rushed to the hospital, where I would get my stomach pumped. They refused to release me, but I talked my mom into signing a form that would release me into her custody. I’m 21 now, and hadn’t had any contact with her in a long time. Now I’m back to where I was before, sitting in the same motel. on one hand I’m grateful to be saved, but I’m not happy that I was.

I try to get out during the day, but it doesn't seem to help, so I often stay in. The thing is, people tell me my life will get better, but right now it's really hard for me to believe, and I find myself with less and less hope everyday. I tend to perform poorly in social situations, and find myself to be frustrated, miserable, and left out. Because of that, I've started to avoid being social, which isn't a whole lot better.

"Mixed feelings...Okay, it's my first time writing on a support page. I'm not sure if this is right place to let whatever I'm feeling out and understand with what I'm feeling, but at the moment I feel like I can't go to my regular support group which are my best friends.

 for a while I've been having suicidal feelings but fortunate enough i never completely pulled it off...everytime I would have these intense emotions to where I would want to suicide, I'm diverted in doing so  by something else that's happening around me, which would take my focus off my me committing suicide, for example my bestfriend getting type 1 diabetes, my mom  finding she had breast cancer  or finding out someone close passing away etc . I can't seem to focus, I feel like a zombie trying to push through day to day activites such as certain errands, going to class or even work. Certain days I just don't want to get up from my bed, due to feeling intense negative self-demeaning emotions. I've cut myself before to get rid of these intense feelings...however haven't touched that option for a long time.

 fast foward to the last couple day...Im feeling the way im feeling as i mentioned before , i was really contemplating on carrying out my suicidal thoughts, and was finding ways to do. Feeling this way I wanted to see one of my bestfriend before going through with it...then her sister (who is another bestfriend of mine) called telling  us  our mutual friend found out she had a tumor in her kidney and not sure if it was cancerous or not. I don't know how to feel about it. As selfish as this sounds, and as ashamed I feel for admitting this I was wishing it was me instead of her, everything I feel this way , someone else happens to be going through a worse ordeal than i am , ans i feel like my suicidal thoughts dont merit to anything. I don't know if it's envy, jealousy or anger or what it is that I feel when I found out about this.....I would love perspective on this...

Sorry for the long post and if my thoughts are all over the place. I'm just trying to figure this out and didn't really know where to go, or who to turn to. Because although I do feel like I want to erase myself from this world. A part of me somewhat wants to fight it.

Thank you guys for your insight.",2.0

"I'm gonna flunk out of collegeI'm in shock and devastated right now. My professor said I plagiarized my research paper so I failed the class. I'm a fucking C average student and this will be the third class in my major that I've failed. I'm afraid I'm going to lose my scholarship or get expelled now for this.


I used four sources, one more than the rest, but I don't think that is plagiarism because I listed them in the works cited portion.


I just emailed him asking if I could turn in an updated paper with the proper sources and he said it's too late. Well that means my passing grade is now failing.


I don't even get what's the fucking point anymore. Even if I do manage to graduate (which will not be in 4 years, I guarantee that) my grades are so abysmal that nobody would hire me or let me into any medical school.

"It hurts sometimesSometimes it hurts watching someone who is happy, someone who wants to live, someone who doesn't have to wake up everyday mad that they didn't fucking die in their sleep hoping one day God drops a shotgun from the sky they can use on themselves. 

Why though? I already made my decision to kill myself no matter what and to avoid happiness because it's so worthless to me but still...Why does it hurt to see this people? Why does it hurt knowing I could have had that? Why does it hurt knowing that these people don't have to plan out how and when they'll kill themselves? 

It's completely moronic. I asked for this and I agreed I would stick with it, yet here I am pondering about life would be like if things were different.

"I feel like I have to end the miseryMy mind is so fuzzy today.  All I can think about is just ending this struggle.  It is draining, and both mentally and physically exhausting.  I feel so unloved, unwanted, and unappreciated.  I didn't hear from my son on Fathers day and my own dad just lectured me until I finally got frustrated with him and left.

Why can't people in my life see how hard life's struggles are on me?  I always tried to be a good guy, a person who always did the right thing.

I have a good job, a decent home and car, but stress coming at me from all angles all the time.  Even a day meant for relaxation turns into me being criticized for any and all things I did years or even decades ago.

I laid in bed last night, discreetly sulking my way to sleep, only to wake up and go back to the same old daily grind.

I have nothing to look forward to when I get home.  I will probably be expected to cook dinner and clean up afterwards despite the fact that my mind is elsewhere.

I am thinking i just might need to find a secluded spot, get a nice new blade, and cut my wrists until I bleed out.

I will be sure to leave my cell phone behind and walk to whereever I decide to do the deed just so they can't track my cars GPS to find me.

Maybe I should schedule my note out to family and friends so that they get it while I am missing(but dead already).

It isn't their faults.  This dark place in my life never seems to go away.  Each time I think I couldn't feel any lower in life, I find that I am feeling even worse than before.

I don't wish this sickness on anyone.  I just want the pain to stop.  It never stops.

I can't talk to anyone close to me as I will just get tossed in a damn psych ward for 3 days to a week before they tell me I am good to go again.

"Relationship on the verge of ending, I want to dieMy live in boyfriend of 4 years, is pushing me away, saying he wants a break. We’ve been together six years. I love him so much and the more we talk and the more I try to fix it the worse I make it, one day he’s talking about moving out and the next he’s holding me in bed, and the next he wants to have sex... then we start fighting about this break situation again... Then we’re spending time together watching tv together, laughing.... I know I should just give him space but I can’t go anywhere, neither can he... I made the mistake of making him my whole world... He’s said some hurtful things, then he’s said I’m the best thing that ever happened to him... I’m so confused I can’t take another broken heart... I’m divorced, in past Relationships I’ve been cheated on, verbally abused, raped, used for money (and no I’m not fat and ugly which is probably what people assume, I have a good job) I just can’t handle any more pain... I feel like I made too many mistakes in this lifetime and it’s too late for me to ever be happy again, or make it right. I know I could find someone else but I don’t want to live without him, and I don’t want to fall in love with someone else. I have nothing left to give in this world.

I planned to go last weekend but found some kind of desire to live and motivation to do my homework blah blah blah so I didn't. Tomorrow, imma have to go do the same hard labor that's been making me want to kill myself for the past 7 years or so and I just can't do it anymore. I don't want to. I'm so close to the end of senior year, the moment when I can move out of this godforsaken household, yet I don't want to continue. I'm exhausted both physically and mentally and my nmom is too selfish to care. I'm going to miss a lot of people and a lot of things, but from what I've heard, the afterlife sounds super amazing, so I think it'll be worth it.

Anyone who would just help me give enough of some motivation to start my studies will be of great help. To be honest I feel useless and I never want my parents to do anything good for me because I wasted their money.

I know there are still chances at life and if I start studying I will surely get selected but my depression and sadness isn't letting me study at all.

i promised everyone i'd get better but now i feel like i just wasted all their time. i cried on the phone with my doctor's secretary this morning. i have been contemplating suicide for hours now. i'm also a victim of incestuous groping, childhood abuse, and isolation. my parents won't let me talk to my siblings because i left their house to stay with my grandparents and escape their homo/transphobia (i'm transgender, ftm, and yes struggling with dysphoria as well).

i have so many problems and no money to solve them and i feel like i'm just deluding myself to think things are going to get any better.",2.0

"I threw away my pills todayI have been depressed before and I have thought about suicide before. I've walked through how to do it, but I never did. I reached out to people and got counseling and I made it out alive. That was last year. This year in the fall just like last year it happened again, but this time it was worse. I know I am loved and I know that people care about me, I would be an idiot to deny that fact. I'm surrounded by an amazing community. But this sadness feels like it's never going to end, and I might not make it to the other side. I just can't escape it. And I feel like I'm dragging other people down.

I got into an accident and had to take heavy painkillers for a couple of weeks. I'm sure those have messed up my head too but even after weeks of being off of them I can't stop being depressed and anxious. This past week and a half or so, I keep thinking about the pills I have left and if I should just use them to kill myself. Last night I couldn't stop crying and just thought about those pills. I just want old me back. This morning I held held the bottle and thought about it. After a while of thinking, I knew how much real me isn't in control right now and threw away the pills. I don't feel much better but I believe the decision I made is for life. Throwing those away I think is a good first step. There's not many people I like sharing this kind of stuff with so I thought I might as well get it off my chest here.",2.0

"I lost my father to suicideOn Sunday 8th December, I found my father in the shed, a cable around his neck, dead. He’d hung himself.
I’m one of the luckiest girls in the world, not only did I get to meet my father, but he was truly my best friend. I know that not everyone gets that in life, there are some who beg their fathers for a relationship only to be ignored. So I guess in a way I’m grateful. 
He knew me in a way that no one else ever will. He just understood me, always knew precisely what I was feeling without me having to tell him a thing.
When I was 11, I first purposely hurt myself. This escalated rather rapidly. My dad knew without even having to see a mark. He took me to the doctors. They tried to help. When I was 13, I tried to take my own life by drinking bleach. Luckily I was saved. When I was 14, I tried again by overdose. I was rushed to hospital. It transpired that the counselling, the medication, just wasn’t enough. I was sectioned for two months. My father was the only one who ever came to visit me in hospital, the rest of my family just couldn’t face me. 
I last hurt myself when I was 15, I’m now 18 and can honestly say I no longer have these thoughts. But if it wasn’t for my dad I know it’d be a different story. He helped me on a whole different level. 
I can’t help but feel like I’m to blame for my fathers death. He knew when I was down, without any communication. How didn’t I realise with him? I know I could’ve helped him, if only I’d have known. 
He left no note, no will, literally nothing. 
I hate to think of my father having those evil thoughts in his head, seeing no way out. He was always there to help not only me, but everyone else. When really it was he who needed help the most. It makes me sick at the thought of it. 
I know his death will be so hard to come to terms with, it’s not something that can be understood the way a disease or physical illness can be. 
Any advice would be really appreciated.",2.0

"I'm 14 and already messed up So, I think that it needs a little bit of backstory: hey suicide watch, I'm new in here. There's nothing else rlly important about me. 

 Before anything else, I'm gonna talk about my ~possible~ future. I'm not suicidal bc of that only. I have anxiety, insomnia and probably depression. My dad is an asshole. My mom don't have a lot of money and I just bring her more pain. I spend more money that I'd like, and even buying food makes me feel really guilty. I kinda ruined my mom's life (btw she never said it but ik, my mom is actually a great person the reason that I'm still alive). The reason for me being suicidal is way more complex than future/grades.

 I have a few good grades. I want to be a doctor. But I can't. I won't make it. I failed my last 4 mini-exams in math. Otherwise, my worst grade is 83. My grade in math is 67 at the moment. 

 In order to get to a good school, I need to change schools next year. To change school, I need a good grade in everything, specially math. Math is supposed to be easy, I know what to do. I just can't, there's always a little something to screw me up. 

 I won't go to enriched classes next year. I won't go to a good Cegep. I'll never be a doctor. And that's because I can't fucking understand math and I miss so much motivation to study/get out of the bed/ask the teacher for help. Did I mentioned that I have anxiety and that keeps me from talking to people, including teachers? 

 I don't even know exactly how to go to a university yet because I'm an immigrant. 


I have anxiety since I can remember. I've been though bullying. I have insomnia since I was a fucking baby. I think that I'm depressed. 

 I can't win against my own head. I can't stop being anxious. I'll be anxious my whole life, it'll never be as easy as it seams to be for everyone else. Sometimes I consider that maybe, just maybe, I wasn't made for life. 

 I think that I messed up my life by not understanding life and I'm only 14. I'm gonna deal with the consequences of it the rest of my life. 

 And I repeat the word ""I"" way too much. Sorry. My English sucks. Don't feel obligated to answer, I just wanted to vent and leave a trait online. If I ever kill myself, I hope that my mom would read this. 

 (Btw if it's mom reading from the future, well, I'm so sorry. I love you) 

 Sorry for everything, guys. Feeling hopeless sucks.

I pretend I don't lie awake thinking of ways to die that won't hurt my mother. But I can't so here I am. If it wasn't for her I would have killed myself ages ago. I know that the day my mother passes will be the day I take a knife to my wrists. 

I want to do as much good as I can while I'm here.  I want to help everyone else. Make someone smile. That's the only thing that gives me meaning. To be useful to someone else.  To have someone acknowledge my existence. 

Every time I am selfish, something horrible seems to happen. When I voice my pain. When everything becomes too much.  When I fall in love.

Nothing ever goes well for me when I want something for myself. I would rather someone else take on my happiness on my behalf. 

I think a lot about how to die. I think I want it to be an accident. Something out of nowhere that no one could have prevented.  Something that no one can blame it on. I hope it's in the fall. It's my favourite season.  

I'm tired.  But I don't want to take my own life because that would be selfish. 

I'm so, so tired.  I don't know how people looking in on me would ever suspect just how broken I am on the inside.  

I'm a parasite feeding off the goodwill of other people.  I make it my nourishment.  A worm. 

I'm not a real person with feelings. I'm empty of hopes and dreams. An empty vessel with nothing to fill it with.  Every day I walk around with my heart hollowed out as I wonder if I will finally get to rest.",2.0

"I let my life go off trackHey,

I've been depressed for a while without giving it much thought, i tried to just ignore it. 3 months ago I had a shitty breakup and that made me very self-conscious, as in I feel like my last 3-4 years were wasted smoking weed and doing nothing constructive. I dropped out of school and i had already pretty much stopped seeing friends. Being alone all the time is starting to get to me, i've been having thoughts about dying or just fleeing somewhere to start over for some weeks now. It's scaring the fuck out of me. I never harmed myself but I came close many times, and I don't have a concrete plan, but I keep imagining ways that I could die by accident and it's weirdly relieving to think about it. I'm scared, I want to tell someone, but the only person i'd be comfortable telling is someone that i've pushed away a lot recently. And I don't want to just have her around so I can vent when I need to, that wouldn't be right. I need tips on how to approach the subject and i need to know if it's okay for me to tell that.

Thanks",2.0

"My maskTo be honest my life looks good to other people, but  I put on a mask. I am funny, decently attractive, and popular. I am 15 right now and had kinda a rough time growing up my parents had a terrible split when I was 8 and then lived together till I was almost 14. Home was in the least to say not a good place, when that was happening but my sadness made sense because my environment was awful. The good news is I have passed that. I genuinely don’t feel like it effects me anymore. My mother is happy my father is so so, but is ok. Whenever I say how I feel everyone goes directly to saying it’s because of my past, but that’s just not true. I realize now that my issues are that  I have many acquaintances, but  no true friends that Hmu, I am alone. I am also completely unmotivated; I can’t get myself to do anything at this point even eat. I just lay in bed and play video games sometimes. I used to be an achiever with straight A’s, a star athlete and pursued my passion of stand-up comedy. I can’t do anything anymore and I feel like my life is lost, I’m really not sure what to do.

I'm so stressed...I can feel it in my shoulders and neck. I constantly am on the verge of tears. If anybody looks at me, I want to fight. I want to scream. 

I thought about killing myself again. It's been more frequent than ever. Just chugging all my prescriptions and waiting...it's tempting. But I know I would be called attention seeking. I don't want to hurt my family- especially my dad and sister. But it's so tempting. One of these days maybe the urge will be stronger than my want to protect my family from pain. 

Im used to these feelings...but I've always been able to dissociate. Always been able to go numb. Always been able to lose myself in my head- away from feelings. I don't know how to handle these constant invasive feelings. I know I will keep on going, I just wish it didn't suck so much. I want to go back to being numb.

This is still happening and nothing is going my way.
My brain is still trying to understand everything and I think he hasn't realized what is really happening.
Losing my girlfriend is just a catalyst for every thing that is wrong with my life.

It got me back to the dark years of middle school. Since then, I met her and she gave me a window to look through life, she was everything to me and I was too.

Now she's gone but I'm stuck. I'm stuck with myself and I honestly don't know if I even want to try to get better.
I almost feel good when feeling bad.
I'm not planning on killing myself very soon because there's still hope, but once the situation settles down, they will be great and happy in their new couple and I will be sad and terribly lonely.

I think when that time comes I'll consider doing it for real, right I don't have the balls to do it.
I also want to travel, and die travelling, maybe, I thought about leaving France with the money I can gather and get a no return trip to somewhere far, maybe USA.
My IRL friends are also somewhat far from where I live and/or they're just not close enough to help me emotionally.

I don't really want to die, I just want to disappear, leave all the bad memories here, because everything in my living area reminds me of her.
Literally everything, I mean, from memories to dreams, from sents to items and even places or food.
I can't listen to music anymore, cause every little line of it has been shared with her in the past 5 years and so it just doesn't help.
I try to find new music but even similar notes get me down.

On top of that, I can't get her back, they don't allow me to see her ,(even though they said they want to stay friends) it's like i've killed someone, but instead, I feel I'm the one being murdered.

My life just has no meaning or purpose now that I can't live for her. She was truly the only reason I'm still alive.

Even in some years when I could be with another person I will still get those baaaad feelings, I would never forget her and if I ever do, please kill me.",2.0

ive tried the medicine and the counseling and anything you could imagine and in the end it didnt work because here i am still wishing i was dead. i get ive got so many fucking years ahead of me i just dont care anymore",2.0
"Losing groundI am a disabled veteran with a minor spinal injury (I use a cane), multiple sclerosis, as well as chronic depression &amp; insomnia on top of everything.   Basically I am fucked.

For a few years from 2013-2015 I kept asking myself ""Is this enough?"" and ""Was this a good enough life?"".   I stalled until now when we're in the middle of 2020 and I know I am not doing alright.   My daily step count is below 1,500 a day, I spend most of my time trapped in my house, and the medication isn't helping given my problems are real versus just a biochemical imbalance.

As it stands I don't see myself getting better, I've lost the one job I was good at (driving for Uber &amp; Lyft), and I don't think I can make it to 2023 or 2024 when the pandemic will likely taper down.  I don't think I can go to my local VA hospital to be put on a psych hold without risking exposure to corona so I am truly stuck where I am at.

I don't know why I am typing this.  I've already got a plan &amp; means but I keep debating in my mind if it is suicide or euthanasia.   Their just doesn't feel like there will be a light at the end of the tunnel for me, even if the pandemic were to ""Just go away"" magically tomorrow, I would still be fucked physically and mentally.",2.0

"Victim of Narcissistic Abuse, I Can't Take It AnymoreI'm getting divorced from my wife, who is a covert narcissist to the tee. For years I dealt with her lies, manipulation, and cheating all in an attempt to keep the family together and because my dumb ass loved her and still does. This eventually turned me into a monster towards her (disclaimer: I have Borderline Personality Disorder). She lied to me about being pregnant with our first so that I wouldn't be careful and then she actually got pregnant. Throughout our engagement I constantly found out about her flirting with other men and twice where I'm pretty sure she slept with them although I have no actual proof other than being tipped off by friends. We got pregnant with twins, got married, I bought her a brand new house and nice vehicles on my credit. Then found out twice that she was flirting with other men again. When I married her I thought she had changed. The second man is a complete dead beat who doesn't see his own kids, doesn't own a car, and has a history of drug and alcohol abuse. This fuck is practically living in my home right now, seeing my children every day while I live in an apartment and get to see them maybe 2-3 times a week. She's blaming me and saying everything is my fault for my rage fits and generally bad attitude towards her after I had found out she was flirting with the first douchebag back in January.

"I'm Fueled By Nothing But SpiteI'm so fucking angry right now. I've been coping with a severe decline in my mental health for over 2 years now, suicidal ideation has been creeping in, but I fought it for 24 long months, and I'm finally done. A group of people who lied to my face and called me their friend spent the last 3 days blocking and burning every bridge between me and them. They imagine themselves as a support group, but they turned on me with no warning and dropped me like a bad habit. 

I was doing fine without them, I was crawling, but I was moving forward. Then they come along and fucking lie to me, make me think I finally have people I can trust with my thoughts and not be fucking alone with my own hell. I'm an idiot for trusting anyone. Silence, for three days, I manage to work through the complete despair and try and connect to some other groups. The ""friends"" who had overlap from this ""support group"" started cutting ties with mutual friends.

I can't fucking stand it. Am I so worthless and abhorrent that you need to avoid contact with me by proxy? Is it one for and all for one, unless that one is me? So I tell these fucks off finally, even though I know they won't even read what I send. I'm punching my own ticket, and they can all fuck off with their faux concern and patting themselves on the back for doing *nothing*.

I'm on borrowed time, and I finally feel free. So I agree to hang with another friend who because of distance has no clue about my depression. I can feel normal at least one more time before I prepare my death and finally free myself.

And one of those fuckers called the cops. I have to lie to my mother, tell her that it's just bs from a fucked up associate. Can't talk, cuts me off with no warning, but does an end around and narcs on me to the cops? Fuck that piece of shit. I'm still going to die, and all they did was make a sweet lady cry.

"i want to kill myself again I am so sick of the constant cycle of wanting to die, recovering, finally feeling happy, and then my life going to shit again, which makes me want to die all over again. 

 I am sick of going to work and wanting to cry every time. Wanting to cry because no matter what I do it's not good enough for some people. Wanting to cry because my coworkers all gang up on me and call me names and make fun of the way I look.... but oh, they're joking so it's okay.

 I am sick of my family making ""jokes"" about me too. I AM SICK OF EVERYONE MAKING FUN OF ME FOR FUCKING EVERYTHING. I'm too sensitive, too emotional, have too much of an attitude, too tall, my hair is too long, my shoes are too dirty, all these stupid comments for what?  Yeah, maybe I'm emotional and sensitive because I've had a ton of family die in a short amount of time, I don't talk to one of my parents, the other parent makes fun of me all the time, my sister only talks to me when it benefits her, my brother doesnt talk to me at all, my friends use me as a therapist but wont talk to me about my problems, the anniversary of when I was sexually assaulted was the other day, no one hugs me or tells me they love me, I use drugs to try to numb my pain but they dont help, my friends ask me to drive them all around town and never give me gas money let alone realize how its running my car down, im broke, blah blah blah etc etc etc.

 I just want everyone to leave me alone. I don't make fun of other people for how they look, the way they act, etc. I see people for who they are and I accept them because they weren't put on this earth to fit my standards. If I don't like somebody, I won't talk to them. I don't make them cry or feel bad about themselves. 

 I mean if nobody likes me then clearly there is something wrong with me so I should just delete my pathetic existence from this earth and save everyone the trouble. My best isn't good enough, I'm not smart enough, not pretty enough, etc. I don't mean anything. So why be nothing and still be here when you can be nothing and be nowehere? That sounds a lot better than this. At work today I was just cleaning and thinking to myself: ""maybe I'll just kill myself tonight."" and maybe i will. I'm nothing and all I'll ever be is nothing.

"I was in a toxic relationship, and I laid hands my (ex)girlfriend last week. I hate myself. Please. Help.I was in a two year relationship with my now ex-girlfriend, and it was a very toxic, abusive, and exhausting relationship. We both loved each other so very much, but we both cheated on each other as well. The joy and laughter we have together is genuine and pure, the sex we have is raw and intense but the fights are equally as intense and toxic as well.

Then one day, I punched, choked and kicked my girlfriend. 

And never in my life, have I felt this disgusted at myself. My parents despises me (I overheard my dad speaking to my mom, and calling me a disgrace, a failure, among many other things), I have no friends to turn to, and I am therefore left alone to my thoughts.

Ever since that incident, I can barely sleep. I would get constant nightmares, I would occasionally get breakdowns that would sometimes last hours on end, and I would eventually find myself shivering in my own pool of tears in a cold, dark empty place that is my bedroom.

The mental and emotional trauma has forced me to think about leaving everything behind and just ending it all. I'm at my wits end, I don't know what to do. I'm shivering and tearing as I write this. I don't know what's happening to me. I hate myself so much, but I don't want to die - but at this point it feels like that the only way out. 

TL;DR: I punched, choked and kicked my girlfriend - and my very own thoughts and inner demons are killing me from the inside. I hate myself and want to die, but like the coward and the sad excuse of a human being that I am, I am afraid. ",2.0

I tried and failed to commit suicide 4 months ago. Ended up in hospital after taking all of my antidepressants and slashed my wrists.

After that I thought I would get some radical help, but anyway they just discharged me after some crappy ""psychological assessment"" and told me to go back to my doctor and get more tablets. Great...

I never went back to my doctor, I have a general mistrust for doctors now so I've just been dealing with things on my own and I've been ok for now but I think that's just because I'm ignoring everything if you know what I mean.



I feel like there's a big void. Empty. And nothing I can do and no one I know can fill it.

I know someday in the future I will want everything to stop again and I know then I won't fail in ending it. 
I know everyone says suicides are cowards and afraid of living. I'm not AFRAID of living. I just hate life. I actually hate it. It really confuses me how people can be happy to be alive. I hear about people that have died and I think they are so lucky. That's just how I feel, it's normal to me. Infact the reason it took me so long to get help with my ""depression"" was because I thought that was just how everyone feels. I thought that was just life.

The only think really stopping me is how my family would feel, I would try to explain best I could that there's nothing they could of done and I was just so unhappy and I just can't. I just can't.

"sorryhow do people keep going? why do people keep going? i cant figure it out. i was in an abusive relationship from age 17-20. its fucked me up. im 23 now and i still wake up screaming. ive lost all of my friends because nobody believed me and they all wanted to be friends with him still because it was easier for them to just be friends with him and pretend like nothing happened than to admit that i was raped repeatedly and controlled for years. you become so out of control you eventually just give up and just accept that thats your life now in situations like that. i didnt tell anyone for 2 years and when i did they didnt believe me. i keep trying to be okay. im in college, i had to take some semesters off because i attempted suicide twice. im 23 now, ive been in therapy for 4 years, and i just cant find joy in anything. i used to be so fucking joyful. most days i just want a hug but im so isolated from everyone i used to love. i still love them all but they didnt love me enough to believe me. im so fucking desperate right now. im very scattered and just retraumatized by something that happened this week. me being suicidal is an every day thing, but its like a volume knob thing, somedays i want it more than others. somedays its a 1 or a 2 and im just checking out my ceiling fan, aware it could hold my weight. other days its a 10 and im smashing things into my head until i bleed so that my pain can be seen on the outside. you cant see ptsd the way you can see a broken leg. people don't just get why im hurting all the time. have to explain ""i was raped and i can hear it every night!"" im tired. of explaining myself. of taking time off school only to just get worse again. i feel stupid and worthless and forgettable. idk what the fuck im doing posting on reddit i pay for a therapist and to call her whenever im just tired of her trying to convince me i should go to an inpatient facility. would rather just die. its cheaper thats for sure",2.0

"Day 10 of spending one hour a night trying to convince myself to kill myselfNot going well as I'm still here obviously. It's a lot harder to hold a gun to your head for an extended period of time then I thought.

So now what I do is pull up a chair in front of a mirror and sit there holding the gun. I normally start off just talking into the mirror about all of the reasons that I am a complete piece of shit and deserve to die. It was starting to feel a little bit practiced so I've really been trying to go through and explain to myself why I am such a failure and a fuckup.

I usually move on to all of my failed attempts of bettering myself, past and present and why I will never succeed at getting better.

It's difficult but I think over time I will wear myself down. If I have time left over I will hold the gun to my head or just visualize shooting myself.

In a fucked up way I feel the best when I am putting myself down during these sessions. It feels good to tell myself that I'm a piece of shit and that I deserve to die.",2.0

"Getting help can't fix meI don't know where to start. I am 20 years old and I'm stuck in a cycle that keeps repeating itself. It has started snowing and it reminds me of the time I was in a very, very dark place about 3 years ago. I somehow kept myself alive during the winter of 2010, and I've never been the same since. 

When I was about 8-9 years old, I was forced into sex by some older kids, and to be honest, I didn't think anything of it. I actually liked it. 
This went on til I was about 14 years old. All my friends were growing up, getting girlfriends, but I wasn't. At first I thought I might be gay, but as I grew older I started to realize that I was becoming what I feared most as a child, a pedophile. High school was really difficult for me because I wasn't like others. I had a great group of friends, everyone liked me because I was nice to everybody, but deep down I was a mess. I started spiraling out of control since then.

 I like to consider myself a giving person. The feeling of making someone happy is all I have. I will never have someone to really love and care for, ever! I don't really spend time trying to figure out why I became ""this"" person. genetic accident? or maybe its just a normal part of being human. I look at myself in the mirror and I am disgusted. I still can't believe this happened to me. I ask myself why everyday, and I just can't take it anymore. The pain I feel is excruciating and mind altering. I don't want to live as a ""fake"". i am tired of having this burden on my shoulders. I am tired of having these thoughts.

Why even try? There is no magic pill that can fix me, there is no psychiatrist that can help me. Why me? I didn't choose this, I hate it, I absolutely hate it. I was unwillingly brought into this world that doesn't accept me. And no matter what anyone has to say about it, you just don't know what its like.

Well, what can I say. I don't qualify to be a productive citizen of this planet. They say ""Live to Love"", and I need to ""love to live"". And if I can't have that, then I'd rather not be here. 

Good luck with everything you guys, please don't let this world get even more shittier than it already is, I'll be watching from above! :)

LossThe urge to kill myself is strong. I miss the love of my life so much. Its been a month. I just want to be with him again. I at first cared about how my friends and family would feel if I offed myself so I just didn't do it. I'm not living for myself anymore. I'm just living for other people so they won't be sad. I've never lived for myself.. I don't care anymore.. &amp; I still won't kill myself and it makes me angry how much I care about other people and how they would feel. I just want to die. I don't want anybody to care if I die. I just want them to let me go. I'm empty and a shell. I get a little happy sometimes but then I get sad and depressed again. I just want to talk to him and hold him and have him hold me forever and tell me that he loves. Just want to be wrapped up in his embrace for eternity. My heart broke when he passed. Its still broken and always will be. I'll always be broken. ,2.0
"I simply stayed home and did nothing, I was basically a shut-in hiding from the world. I had really awful anxiety at one point, I never went to the doctor for it, but there was a time when I got a panic attack and I had to call a friend, who helped me get through it. Then everything changed, I got an opportunity to work at a really tough (to be honest I would call the working conditions atrocious), minimum-wage job but I learned a lot of life lessons (and it changed my view on society). Then I started reading more books to improve myself, and that was when I started to earn some savings. I returned to school and the first semester back I managed to get As in half of my courses.",1.0
"What is the point of living if you’re constantly in pain ?This is a serious question: what is the literal point of being alive ? It seems very pointless in today’s society to be either dead or alive because someone can easily replace you. People with mental illness are just reduced to simple statistics. There is nothing worth fighting for on this god forsaken cesspool planet. I can’t find someone who truly loves me (mutually or romantically). I do know I have friends online who love be but it’s never enough. I want to meet them and hug them. I adore fictional characters and animals more than any other fleshy human at this point. Everything seems so hopeless. I’ve attempted suicide over like 20 times throughout this year and nobody cares. Nothing would change if my attempts worked. I always hear people say “keep fighting” and “smile and survive”. Keep fighting for what ?? There is nothing to fight for. Life is short and not worth anything anyway. And plus, everyone always says the same thing: “talk to someone, call the hotline.” The hotline is fuckshit, and usually when you talk to people about it, they want nothing to do with it. There are those very very rare people who are very compassionate and express love for someone just trying. I’m stuck with clowns 🤡 who keep denying depression and it’s driving me insane. Nobody around me would actually listen to what I’m saying. And on my best days, suicide still seems like a good idea. It’s like I can’t go back to being un-suicidal. Everyone around me can just die for being turds. “It gets better”. Not for everyone. I might live for a few more weeks but then attempt suicide again. That’s my life now, as unhealthy as it sounds. It doesn’t matter because everything is pointless and we will all die one day right ? So what’s the point ? In today’s society, you always need money. Money. If I had like 10M dollars most of my problems would go way. I don’t care if I’m lonely af, I’ll be financially stable. But, I don’t have any drive to do anything, I just keep thinking about dying and ending my life. I don’t know why but I feel so messed up that suicide has a strange importance to my life.",2.0

"I'm here about to cry and I can't even tell my mom how bad I am anymore. Am 19FFirst of all, I am not open to talking over PM. Makes me fucking anxious idk why.

I have a bunch of mental bullshit and had to drop out of regular highschool and graduate using independent study. I failed out of community college.

Now, I know my dad is disappointed in me and doesn't like me. I don't like me either. I've been sleeping a lot lately and having a very hard time getting up, I just pass out again. I woke up to yelling. My dad was yelling to my mom how I'm so stupid for failing out of school, blaming me for all kinds of stuff. They don't know I heard. ""She's trying!"" My mom said, ""WELL THATS NOT ENOUGH"", my dad yelled. It's ok dad, I don't like me either. I know I'm not enough. 

My mom has mental bullshit too and me coming to her breaking down just makes her worse and my dad bitched at me for it and was on her side, so this is why I'm up in the dark refusing to let my worthless ass cry. 

Cutting doesn't help anymore. The next step is death, and I can feel myself getting close to it. I've tried and I can't even please my own dad, and I can't get my shit together. I'm surprised he hasn't kicked me out to the streets, but he has threatened. I won't be able to hold down a job and I don't want to be a waste of welfare or disability money.

I’m so desperately lonely, but trying to date other people is somehow worse. Every other man I’ve met pales in comparison to him. I truly don’t think I’ll ever meet someone who is half of the man he is. He was the sunshine in my life and without him I feel like I’m drowning. I wake up every day, remember he doesn’t want me, and want to go back to that state of unconsciousness. When I’m not crying I am like an emotionless zombie.

Life is ugly and people are cruel, it’s really that simple. 

Everyday I get out of bed and go to work. I fucking try so hard to participate in society but I feel like it’s pointless. 

For most of life, the dream of finding someone to love who understood and accepted my pain was keeping me alive. I found him and we spent two magical years together but it turns out he didn’t love me. And my deeper fear came true: that the person I loved most in this world would disappear. He left me and found someone else. I can’t get over the betrayal. 

Thoughts of suicide have been constant. I can’t even get help because I’m uninsured. And I’ve spent years navigating this broken mental health system. Pills don’t work, therapy has failed me, honestly taking mushrooms was what saved my life. It helped me see things from a different perspective. I think they wore off, because I’m starting to feel trapped in the old thought patterns again. Oh, it doesn’t help that my ex was a fucking therapist.

All the homeless people in this world have somehow found something to live for, but I have not. I thought it was work, but that never happened. It isn't sex or love: I can't do either.

I hate those assholes who call suicides selfish. Whatever feeling of loss they feel, the deceased felt 80 times more of that.

"Terrified of becoming homeless. I want to die to avoid living on the streets.The long version is here: [You can read it if you'd like.](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2rcj39/i_19f_feel_like_cinderella_and_fear_being_homeless/)

The short version is that I moved in with my boyfriend a month ago because I was thrown out of my house, and I essentially became Cinderella. I do almost 100% of the house chores (that should be split between 5 people) and it's still not enough. I scrub the bathroom tile on my hands and knees with a toothbrush and nobody cares. My ""stepdad in law"" calls me lazy and says horrible things about me because I've been having trouble getting a job during the holidays. 

He's been jobless for over a year (he's in his 40s) and spends his time high on pills. He refuses to get a job. He attacked my boyfriend's mom last night for sticking up for me. He left last night, but he'll be back because he always is. She's the stereotypical abused woman that doesn't leave the guy hurting her. 

I'm scared that he'll make her choose between him and me, and I'll end up on the streets. I've been abandoned by everyone even though I tried my best, and I just don't know what to do. 

There's a shotgun in the basement that's been crossing my mind frequently. I'd rather be dead than homeless and I just don't know what's wrong with me that makes everyone throw me away. ",2.0

"my last attempt makes suicide less scaryit was an impulsive but i was at a very difficult spot, mentally, in my life and it was too overwhelming. i’ve always been passively suicidal and had these ideations since i was 11. it’s nothing new to me and that day, i just snapped. this was about a month and a half ago but i still remember certain bits so clearly, despite dissociating the days following. i took an overdose that was deadly lethal for my size but ended up vomiting up what seemed like most of it because my stomach couldn’t handle the burning and bitterness. i spent about 20 minutes on the floor, nearly choking on my own vomit and my everything burned but i didn’t feel regret. years of pain and self hatred made me believe that i deserved it. i eventually did call the ambulance out of confusion and pain that made everything seem fuzzy, i actually hung up the first time before i got to say anything. i felt ashamed and even more depressed the entire hospital experience because i realized that they were fighting to keep me alive. since then i have been through the mental health system but it doesn’t seem to be helping. i’ve been in an out of therapy for the past 3-4 years and i don’t feel satisfied with what i’ve worked on. my parents blamed me for what happened and have always refused to talk about mental health, this only closed that door even more. i feel hopeless and so emotionally unstable, even my closest friends have drifted away and i don’t want to burden them with my suicidal thoughts. i’ve spent the past weekend writing plans and i already have everything prepared. it’s so methodical and i did my research to mix together medications to achieve the most effective outcome. i even gave myself a week to see if this was just another impulsive decision but it’s become so automatic to me that i can’t think of anything else that will make me feel alive again, ironically.",2.0

"I'm worried about my brother but he is halfway around the world in the military and is exhibiting strange vocalizationsHe's in the US military and is back from his second deployment. Ever since he's returned he's been having serious issues with depression and alcohol abuse. He will call me, usually drunk, and tell me that he wants to kill himself and thinks about it constantly. He claims he won't follow through on it due to the pain it would cause the family and I mostly believe him, but some of his speech patterns make me doubt he's being completely honest with me. 

He will generally continue to talk about his situation until he is crying in a public pace, which isn't too extreme. What does worry me is that he screams out involuntarily in the middle of sentences in the public place he's calling from. I'm afraid it might indicate an issue deeper than depression that may enable him to act irrationally. 

I've had issues with depression myself and I understand what he's going through to an extent. He tells me he thinks of suicide every day, and I do too, but that he'll never follow through on it. He tells me that when he was deployed he'd try to get himself killed (since it wouldn't appear to be suicide to the family) by acting like a lemming on PCP but he managed to get through his deployment unscathed.

After much effort I've managed to convince him to see a military psychologist, but I'm afraid he'll be less than completely honest since he's worried about losing his clearance.

B was doing well until early last week and they spiraled, speaking of suicide and wanting to just run away. I urged them to get help.

""Mom and Dad love you so much and they would give you their kidneys if it meant you would be happy. Losing you would ruin them.""

"So I’ve been taking 40mg paroxetine for around 3 months (I don’t go to her straight away) and have been fine until the past two weeks.

"Why does life feel like a movie that has been on for way too long?I don't feel like killing myself as much as I just feel disappointed by life itself. Nothing is new or exciting. Nothing is stimulating. Everything feels like it is either predictable or simply happens for little to no reason. How do people get fulfillment from existing like this? How are people able to build relationships with one another when there are so many obvious flaws to life that have simple solutions but will never actually come to light? All memes aside I feel like I am taking crazy pills and like I am the only person still actually paying attention to what's going on around them, as arrogant as that sounds.

"I'm 26 this year from Singapore, happy to have experienced many things in life but I wish I succeeded in my suicide attempt 10 years ago.I’ve always been depressed from a young age. My parents were verbally abusive; my mother in particular was borderline insane and used really mean words on me. She was bullied by her coworkers when she was young, I can’t help but feel that she just needed to vent all her pent-up frustration on a poor, defenceless child. In a way I feel that it’s my fault I caused her even more stress but I wish I was never born to this family.

My parents gave me a weird name that was mispronounced everywhere, even my primary school teachers made fun of it. I still have terrible memories of that creeping anxiety when a new teacher reads all names off the class list and gets to mine – when they certainly pronounce it wrong, drawing laughter from the whole class. When I cried, I was only sent to the principal’s office and told not to be so sensitive.

I could never make friends in class. Everyone avoided me because I was so quiet. I was the weird kid who became the “class plague” and the butt of everyone’s jokes. My parents never realized I was depressed, they just broke me further and screamed at me when my grades declined.

I was referred to a psychiatrist by a teacher’s advice. Instead of being concerned, my parents were furious. “I didn’t raise you to be crazy! I didn’t raise you to be mentally ill! Why can’t you just be normal?!”

One day, I couldn’t take it anymore. I downed all the pills I was given, at one go. I was so certain I would be at peace, but I only woke up the next day feeling absolutely horrible. My mind was awake, but my entire body felt limp and powerless. I struggled to drag myself to the toilet to throw up. I cried so hard, I was miserable that my attempt to escape pain failed.

I tried to be normal – being conscripted for mandatory 2 years of military service kind of helped me break out of my socially awkward shell. I slowly began making friends and integrating into society. I never could keep my friends though – they all drifted away soon enough.

 Now here I am, 26 years old, a university dropout, working a low-paying job, lonely and depressed as f\*\*\* and wishing I was never born. Feeling useless at seeing people my age growing up in loving families, experiencing happiness and living comfortable lives.

I’m too much of a coward to leap off a building, afraid of choking on a rope, don’t have a car to poison myself with CO, and sure as hell not gonna stab myself. I can only wish euthanasia was legal in my country.",2.0

"I feel behind in lifeFor context im a 19 year old male. I moved across the country (USA) when i was about 14-15 and had life pretty normal. Moving situation tanked and ended up living with a friend in butt fuck no where North Carolina. At 16 we could afford to move to the original place (Virginia beach). Since then i was kind of messed up, and depression got really bad. Couple that with prescriptions from doctors that made me a zombie, i didnt make friends. I was already bad at math before the move, but I got royally fucked in class when i arrived. In Virginia (yay for common wealths), they have a test called an SOL. If you dont pass that test at the end of year/semester, you don't pass. No way in HELL im passing math. (Yes i stayed after and tried studying)After looking for any solution and maybe a math disability, i ended up dropping out and enrolling in a private online school so i can ""cheat"" most of it. I still havent finished my schooling, they have  proctored tests, so I'm fucked for the final. That brings me to the main point im making. I dont have my drivers license (or any permit) and i havent graduated high school yet. I feel like every fucking 16 year old i see is driving and/or graduated already. How did my dominos fall like this.. Im starting a job with a small landscaping company so at least im doing SOMETHING with my life. But i cant help but feel like a failure. How do i talk to other people like this? ""Yeah I can pick you up, let me ask mommy first""... Or lying about graduation. I feel so embarrassed and hindered. ",2.0

"risky coping methodsSo, I’m going to be honest. I’ve been suicidal for a very long time and I try to do all I can to avoid doing what seems inevitable. But I just can’t do it anymore. I don’t really care enough or have much strength after going through numerous long-lasting depressions. I’ve pretty much given up on everything and right now I’m just trying to make it longer and make what time I have left worth it. I’m trying to live ad happily as I can, so I have resorted to taking in massive amounts of caffeine and and drug it myself to sleep at night. I know it’s not healthy and to be honest, the caffeine doesn’t even really do much for me, but at least it’s something. God knows father medicine doesn’t help, regardless of what I try.  I’m not even really sure why I’m posting this. I used to think I wanted someone to talk to but I’ve realized through numerous therapy sessions that I don’t really have any way to describe what I’m feeling, nor do I really even know what I would say. I guess this is more of a “venting post” than anything else. Anyway, I’m probably going to inadvertently kill myself with chemicals. But I honestly have no idea how else to cope because I’ve tried almost everything I can think of. If anyone had any suggestions, I’m all ears.

Long story short we ended up making out a little bit both of us being pretty fucked up on some weed. I kissed her first but then she kissed me back and kept going. We had long conversation afterwards and during and before and all was good. I thought nothing of it and was kinda happy that it happened.

This morning i wake up to her telling me that I took advantage of her and that I knew she would never do that when she is sober. I had absolutely no intention of taking advantage of her and was 100% sure that night that she wanted it to happen and was glad it happened. 

Now she pretty much completely hates me and cannot even look at me. This hurts me so bad to know that i hurt her since she is so important to me even if i didn't know I was hurting her. There is nothing i can say to fix it no matter how much I apologize and say it was my fault.

I went to the store and bought some rope and went into the forest only 5 minutes by walk away from my house and tied a noose and tied it to a tree. I contemplated for awhile before going back home but I know that I can go die in 5 minutes flat whenever i want to. she is the only one I can talk to, the only one i wanna talk to. That is also why I am writing on here is because i have nobody else to open up to. 

All i need is 5 minutes of courage and I will be gone.

This is not the first time I've been suicidal but this definitely put me over the edge of being serious and ready to do it.

"Scared at how suicidal I have become and know I need help, but worried about repercussions of looking for help. Two years ago I was in a bad spot. I now relies I was dealing with PTSD at the time, but was never diagnosed. I became super suicidal and had six failed attempts. After the sixth attempt and failure I hit rock bottom and asked for help. I got my mother to drive me to emergency and I proceeded to tell them how low I was feeling and how failing in my attempts to kill myself was only making things worse - yet another thing I was screwing up in life. They gave me the option of becoming an inpaitent or an outpatient and my stupid pride made me choose outpatient. I see now i likely would have benefited tremendously from time spent in the hospital where I would have had more hands on treatment. Two years have past since this time and I have been stifling my continuing suicidal thoughts. I would think of offing myself at least once a day, but it would come and go quickly and I was able to more or less function okay. Recently the suicidal thoughts have become much stronger and longer lasting. I spend most of my days loathing my very existence and while I am mostly sure I wont act on these feelings, there is a part of me that worries I will. I want help. I dont want to die, I want the pain of depression and self-hate to end, but death seems like the only true relief. I have to talk myself out of calling 911 on a nightly basis because my feelings are so strong I worry I will act, but stop myself because of the shame and stigma of mental illness. It is as though getting the help I really do need is a form of defeat and yet more failure and really...I cant stomach any more feelings of failure...which just turns the cycle of wanting to just end it all as a means of escape all over again. I am an educated woman, I know mental illness and depression are real things, that there is nothing wrong in asking for help, if anything it is a good sign - I know these things rationally speaking, but it is not my rational side that seems to be winning.

"Throwaway for obvious reasons.I've lived with suicidal ideations since puberty. I'm 30 years old, and I just created my first real ""plan"". I don't know if this qualifies though - it's less a plan to suicide and more a plan to take it out of my hands. 

In March, I intend on heading out to the Smoky Mountains of North Carolina and just, staying. I would have a fully equipped Bug-Out Bag with the intent on survival, but living in a dense forest would come with risks of exposure, infection, bears, etc. 

I still wrote a note to my friends and family. It still feels like a suicide note because I am saying goodbye to everyone. I am not telling them where I am going, because I do not want them to be able to find me. If I survive a few years, and decide to come back, I'm not sure I would reach out to them. It feels cruel to do that. 

I am posting this because I know if I tell my therapist or husband or anyone that I have this plan, they would do everything they could to stop me. I want to live off the land, and separate myself from society/capitalism, but they would never understand. How can tell them the truth and still live the way I want to?",2.0

"it’s so hard to not think abouttw: self harm

ive been left with this topic alone for years. i never had the courage to tell anyone about my genuine desire to just not exist anymore. i hate hate hate being vulnerable to people because it just makes me feel worse. 

three years ago i had this really bad episode which still leaves me a few scars i can see to this day. not really noticeable but its still there. and i havent told anyone about it. everytime i look at it, it reminds me of how i haven’t gone anywhere with these bullshit thoughts, and that i’ve made no progress. everyone says this but i genuinely feel so alone. i have no one trustworthy to rely on and it just really sucks. cant even tell people im supposed to be close to.. i feel so cold and empty yet somehow it still really hurts. because i do want to feel but at the same time i dont because nothing ever goes right. ive been feeling like shit for years and have came to no peace in my mind. cant even remotely love myself. idk how far im going with this but i just needed to vent. im probably making no sense. i dont know how my life will end, because as much as i fantasize and consider ending it, i just cant do that to my family. what a shitty thing to do on my end. so yeah, im feeling trapped here. its a hellhole. nothing is really getting better yet i read these posts and still tell anyone i meet to keep going. what a complicated person lmao i hate myself :))",2.0
"Im so sick of having to see myself in the mirror everyday and having to deal with my emotions with no way to release them.I stopped caring about a year ago, i found real love and i made the mistake of thinking that they will love me no matter how i look. I stopped caring about my apperance. I gain so much weight. So much. I cant do the same activitues i used to. I cant stand looking at myself anymore. I slept around and let myself be sexually abused and let guys use me to make me feel important even though they saw me as meat. But i did it because it was the only compassion and attention i ever got before I fell in love with the most wonderful human ive ever met, who helped me see what i did wrong and how i let myself ruin my dignity. Our sex life was so wonderful at the beggining but something changed in my head and i couldnt stop thinking about the sexual abuse i was put through especially one memory. Its been months and months since the last time i had sex with him and hes so broken he says he feels unattractive, unwanted, disgusting but i cant figure out how to show him i love him because sex is the onky thing that will fix this. He knows the abuse has bothered me more as of about 6 months ago but he can only take so much sexual frustation and i cant bring myself to be touched or caressed without crying. I have no motivation to loose weight, i have no motivation to seek a therapist, i have no motivation to clean myself. On top of it i need to fix my relationship because weve created a life together already but its so hard to try when my own mind is so broken. Im a prude piece of fat garbage who makes her boyfriend starve from sex and lets herself be used and thrown around. I have no motivation to keep moving forward. Please excuse this whole post and the grammar. I poured my thoughts out and i dont even think it makes sense looking back at it. Theres too much to talk about. I hate this i hate my mind and im letting myself ruin my own life. I want to die. Im so scattered right now.",2.0

"how do i make a blade sharperi made this throw away account out of desperation you could say. ive been struggling with suicidal thoughts since my pre teen years and attempted 2 or 3 times thru my adolescence (my memory is fuzzy and ive struggled with a lot of fucked up symptons probably due trauma and whatnot plus i think i repressed a lot of traumatic memories so my memory is even worse). and ive been planning on attempting again for a while now. very few things keep me away from attempting, one of these things being self harm. i know its not healthy but my blade is dull (its a pencil sharperner blade, ive been looking into buying an actual razor blade but pandemic and quarentine came around) and i really really dont have any other option here. therapy is out of the question given my current situation and confinding in friends is also not an option. so if you have any advice onto how to sharpen a pencil sharpener blade thatd be nice. since its one of the few things that keep me ""in line"" if that makes sense.

(sidenote: no i cant buy another pencil sharpener. i started cutting at a young age and attempted suicide also at a young age so my family strictly forbids me getting my hands on anything that i might possibly harm myself with. that doesnt mean that theyre great or caring btw but i wont get into my life story in this post. anyways yeah just give me advice on how to make it sharp again)

"I don't know what to doI don't know what's the best place to ask for help. I don't know where to start. I'm from an Asian family with an Asian upbringing. I don't have the resolve to take time off university to get my shit together or whatever because all I've ever been taught since I was born was ""you need to study hard! Competition is very tough out there!"" ""Work a respectable job!!"" (I'm studying engineering right now) ""This kid on TV finished high school by 12 y/o he's so much better"" 

Until recently my family started noticing how lifeless I am and they've been really easygoing with me but that way of life has been ingrained into me. 

I moved to Canada 3 years ago for university and that's when I started falling away from happiness. All I did was study and I left all my friends behind. I'm very social and I can make friends easily but both my personality and my relationships are shallow. I haven't properly hung out with anyone in 3 years and I'm very homesick. Except I don't have a home to return to because all my friends moved to different countries. I don't click with anyone here. I don't know how to move friendship past classrooms. Sorry for being sort of incoherent. I don't know how to arrange my thoughts right now... 

Over the last few years I've been ignoring how lonely and sad I feel but occasionally I notice it and break down in tears. My first thought of finding peace is always to just end everything.

"Fiancee feels cheated, I feel worthlessSo I'm getting married in two weeks and my bachelor party was this past weekend.  It was always joked that I would end up getting a lap dance at a strip club and my fiancee even joked that she would pay for it.

The bachelor party goes well and I'm fed several drinks (to the point of minor blood alcohol poisoning the next day, far and beyond the most drink I've ever been).

The planned events end and it is up to me for what to do next.  So I say ""well why not a strip club?""  It's something I was always curious about since high school so I thought, it's now or never.  I really was just interested in the novelty of it.

The place is disgusting, seedy and gross, but my friends and I had a kick rolling our eyes at one another.

I finish my last drink of the evening (maybe number 15, either way far too much) and i'm told by my friends to receive a lap dance.  I stumble to the back and receive what I can only imagine is a typical dance, except the girl took my hand and placed it on her chest.  At no point through any of this did I feel any attraction to the women there.  Even this one girl was not of my choosing.

The next day I tell my fiancee everything.  Not out of any sort of guilt, but more because I wanted to share in the freakshow.  My fiancee who was on her bacheloette party says she was very good that it was extremely tame.  We had laid down a no ""bases"" rule beforehand, so the fact that I touched this lady's bare chest she feels as though I cheated on her.

I cannot explain to her enough that I was as far from attracted to the girl as possible but she still feels betrayed.  There is no talk of if splitting up over this, but she is very hurt and I feel like the biggest failure.

I can't bear the idea of hurting her, and I know losing me would hurt her more, but I cannot think of anything other than punishing myself.

I've never made an attempt before, but I did use to hurt myself.  I feel it would be putting too much on her shoulders to come out with this, but I can hardly function enough to think of anything else.

"I want to kill myself because I’m an incel and unpopular and Idk how to improve myself because I’m a loserI know this is easily the biggest most first world problem to ever make someone miserable but it’s making me want to die so much, I’m 17 and still nobody wants to have sex me, my dad always tells m about how when he was 14 lots of girls slept with him and how he was super popular and it makes me so ashamed since I’m nothing like he was my age. He had tons of friends and hot girlfriends and partied nearly every weekend and drove this really cool 80s car when he turned 16 (he loves that car so much he has three pictures of it in our house), I don’t even have a car or a license so it just makes me feel worse. I want to die so much and I’m starting to think it will be worth the pain I cause my dad too since his life is completely fine as it is. 

PS. If you don’t know what an incel is, it’s short for involuntary celibate - someone (almost always male) who craves sex but doesn’t get any.

I have a double mastersdegree in a field I really dislike.

"I've been fantasizing about killing myself since I was 13 years old and I think it's timeI'm a 16 year old girl, my life is very average and to be honest most of my problems aren't as worth it and rough to be mentioned. I've struggled with an eating disorder since I was 10, my suicidal thoughts have been around since I can remember and there's nothing I can do to keep them away from my mind; no one has ever noticed any of that, not even my parents. I like to think that this is due to my ""pretending to be ok"" skills but deep down I know is because nobody really gives a shit about me, again, not even my parents. 

Every single decision that I've made since I was conscious about my bad mental state has been made in order to get better and experience happiness for once in my life. Nothing seems to work out, I can't even bother to fuck things up because there's no good thing at all around me, everything is fucked up already and no one really cares about me. 

To be clear, I know that I'm going to eventually kill myself. I have no idea how, when and where but I just know that I am going to do it one way or another. The only thing that haunts me is the fact that my self-induced death will represent a major trauma in my friends' lives and will scar my parents forever. I absolutely don't want that, I just want to go in peace knowing that no one will be hurt in the process or afterwards. 

Maybe my life will get better in a couple of years, maybe if I try harder on therapy somethings will start to go the right way in my life, but the emotions that I've been dealing with for the past couple of years are just too painful, my god they are. 

Only thing I can do is pray that there's no other type of life after death because I ain't willing to breathe anymore after I take my own life, that and distancing myself from everyone so that they find easier to face my death when I eventually commit it. 

I know this hole text can sound overwhelmingly condescending and typical in a depressed teen, and I'm sorry for that but I can't take it anymore. I'm going to wait til my birthday for my final decision even though I'm 100% sure I'll eventually kill myself.

"I can't stop screwing up my family's life.Today I got into a car accident. I don't think anybody was hurt physically, but I was at fault and don't have insurance. The damages are in excess of $3,000 for the other party's vehicle alone, even though all damage was purely cosmetic. I just finally managed to pay off a speeding ticket last month, and that was over $200. I have a medical disorder that keeps me from working many kinds of retail and labor-intensive job besides traditional office jobs, and due to my age and ""lack of experience"" for office work those kinds of places just aren't interested in me, so my spouse is stuck working long hours to make up for the fact that I'm a piece of crap that can't even kick off my own jewelry business that I've been trying to get up and running for years now.

I've been contemplating ending my life since before we even got together, always thinking about how nice it would be to just not be alive since the day I turned thirteen in the middle of a traumatic relationship. I'm now approaching twenty-five.

In twelve years, I've been in countless abusive relationships because I was so scared of being alone that I stayed with anybody that gave me any kind of attention, I've miscarried two children, and my biggest achievement is that I graduated high school with the eleventh-highest GPA out of fifty people. I've never been to college, not because I haven't applied, but because I haven't been accepted even when I genuinely wanted to go. I have all these dreams and aspirations for my life, but I'm too damned let-down to act on any of them because when some small good thing happens, there's always a massive bad incident waiting right around the corner and the good stopped outweighing the bad a long time ago. I can't even successfully lose weight without falling down the stairs and breaking my ankle two weeks into my diet and workout regimen. I just want to end it, so I can stop screwing up the life of my husband and daughter.

I don't have car insurance, but I have a $100,000 life insurance policy and if I make it look like an accident somehow then they'll still get the money, plus they won't have to deal with me constantly messing up and making their lives so much harder than they should be.

But the last two year i have been contemplating suicide on and off, and thats fucking hilarious, looking in retrospect, i have improved my life in all the way that i hated it. And now i am considering this... 

I don't know why really i just don't want to live anymore, no one hurt me, no one hates me or anything. At least thats how i see it.

I'm 22, never had a real love interest (i think), only had 2 sexual experiences. Never really been good at anything besides problem solving, suck at math and grammar, but i do well with languages. I'm cocky at times and i am known to be hilarious. Yet i feel empty, i have recently taken up a new hobby and its nice.

I would miss eating, considering there's is only the void in my future (be it now or in 60+ years). I'm not religious to any extent but have considered becoming just to fill something.

My life has been good, only some small low key shit like a small amount of molestation - but from a person only a couple of years younger than me, and i have written it off as tomfoolery, because i wasn't forced - but guess it's still molestation since i at the time didn't know what we where doing. But nothing that has left an emotional scar.

"The person whom I had trusted the most has gotten tired of meThere used to be someone here at school who was willing to care about me. She took the time to learn about me, was patient with me, and helped me with some of my suicidal tendencies and self harm, and was a great friend. She was one of the first people that I met at college (we actually met on tumblr through a mutual who found out that we were going to the same place). But now, I've extinguished what we had. We got into a series of fights because of something that I was (unintentionally) doing. She was hurt and angry so I don't blame her for hurting me back. 

I had planned my third and what I thought was going to be my last suicide attempt. I was in a bad place. I walked a mile down the train tracks and lied down, waiting for the last train of the night to end my life. But I was on the wrong side of the tracks and didn't die because I'm too stupid to figure out inbound and outbound.

Later on I told her what had happened. She got very angry at me and made the entire situation about her. She made me feel worse.

I've learned how little she actually cares about our friendship now. I miss her. And even worse, I love her. She won't leave my mind.

"I may as wellA girl I was close to in Hospital, who I last saw ten days ago, was able to kill herself in the psychiatric ward. They weren't looking after her properly, when I was there I had to stop her from killing herself. 

She kissed me and it was kind of awkward but I cuddled her anyway because it was nice, she was nice and she wanted a cuddle. When I didn't want to cuddle much anymore the last few days I was there because I was feeling agitated, I hope she didn't see it as a rejection. 

I never had anyone I know kill themselves before. It hurts. She was so sad, and now she's dead. I've only known for 4 hours and the image of her dead body keeps popping into my head. Our interactions pop into my head. How I might have hurt her and how absent my emotions were at the time popped into my head.

"Question - Has anyone else struggled with wanting to 'check out' for decades (38m)?22 years after my first diagnosis of major depression, and only recently (prior two months) has it become completely debilitating.

"Feels like Im playing life on hard modeFeeling like nothing has gone right for me in the past 6 years or so.

I graduated almost 3 years ago with an engineering degree and have been unemployed/underemployed ever since. I've really tried everything to find a job but unemployment for youths where I am is some like 20% and no one is hiring. I spent 6 days a week at school working on a very technical extracurricular project during semester, and every weekend between semesters as well,  hoping it would help me land a job. I wasted 4 years of my life, killed my social life, and I have nothing to show for it.

In my second last semester one of my best friends died. I had only been seeing him once every few months because of school so I missed out on seeing him a lot before we lost him. I had to help his parents organise stuff for the funeral and spoke as well. 

A year after that I got a job where I had to do a lot of travelling, Monday to Friday every week. On the weekends I was so exhausted I just laid on the couch and did the paperwork I couldnt during the week while watching TV. It was a terrible job, and once again I neglected everything, including my friends, just to do this shitty job that didnt even pay well and had no career advancement. In July my other friend passed away the week I quit my job so I would have more time to hang out with him.

When I go on LinkedIn quite a few of my colleagues from school have landed jobs (I cannot figure out how). My ""friends"" from university are also reluctant to help me out, even though they help other people in the same friend group. I'm really bitter about hearing things going well for people when I can't get any kind of break.

tldr I have no job, no prospects, and I've lost two of my best friends. It feels like every choice I make is a mistake and I cant seem to make things better.

Edit: The main reason I'm feeling so angry and bitter is that it feels like I have no control over any of this. I try and do the ""right thing"" and it keeps fucking me over. I try and I try but I only seem to dig myself a deeper hole. I want to feel like I have at least some control over any of this.",2.0

Every relationship I’ve ever had blew up in my face and my last just ended and I’m pregnant and can’t fathom having a baby with him or keeping it and the hole being dug even bigger, and termination is terrifying for me. 

I’ve been suicidal for a long time, but it’s finally starting to feel like something I *need* to do. My son doesn’t deserve to see his mother fail and love this way. I am a physical and financial burden to everyone I love. I can hardly hold a job anymore because I’m fucking miserable and I bend at the chance of any short lived happiness, often times my jobs causing direct misery in my life. It’s too much.

"I'm TiredI'm tired of fighting and I want to give up. I have been struggling with schizoaffective bipolar for almost five years now. I'm lucky in that it hasn't affected my functioning too badly but I'm tired of fighting it. I have to work so hard just to pretend to be a functional adult in social spaces and it sucks.

Its not all bad though. Along with the depression comes highs. My last high was two years ago. It snuck up on me like a thief in the night. I was constantly taking sleeping pills to sleep the days away when I wasn't working, I felt defective, and I felt depressed. Just all around shitty. Then one day I couldn't get the sleeping pills and I couldn't sleep.

The most amazing feelings came over me after like a day of not sleeping. I felt euphoric, like life mattered, I stopped buying sleeping pills, started exercising, I felt connected to life. Instead of thinking there were too many hours in the day, I started to think there weren't enough. I had to eventually go back on my medication because I started hallucinating but that feeling of vitality lasted about six months.

I said all that to say, I now feel disconnected from life. I feel like I felt before my period of positive energy. I don't care about anything. I go to work and play video games but that's it. I haven't paid my rent in months. I take Advil pm everyday to sleep. I don't care that I'm not taking care of myself. I dont care that my life is going to shit.

I don't actually want to die, not really, it's like my mind is going, ""well here is a way out, consider me"".

It was like looking through the keyhole of that door so to speak

I try not to indulge the thoughts cos they give me shivers and make me feel extremely guilty. I do my best to ignore them, sometimes they pop up briefly like a ""hey just do it"" in such a casual way I can just ignore them, sometimes at the stupidest things, I put the wrong coffee in my cup the other day and said to myself ""why the fuck havnt I done it yet"" and I had to argue with myself for a bit and tell myself to shut up repeatedly. Other times it is pretty deep and frightening where I feel like it is a legitimate choice. I feel that at this moment in time I can just keep going listening the the thoughts each day with a great amount of certainty that I wont right now. I can't control the thoughts but I let them brush over me with a ""not today demon"" sort of attitude, I can't really describe it

I am just scared that this is the start of something ya know? Scared it will get worse like many people here, scared I will actually truly want to die at some point. Like when I look to my future I see that I am dead by suicide but right now at this time I am not letting my thoughts push me over the edge, the influence of the thoughts haven't trapped me yet, ya know? Like I can be objective and rational and dispel them with distractions but the thoughts still scare me deeply. I can't get help or therapy, my anxiety is too great, so I am just doing what I can to make sure I stay in this sort of not a major risk phase which is to not indulge them, so no more writing suicide notes etc. I don't want to be the guy who kill myself like I see in the future.

"Crisis Lines experiencesHi, I’ve always had terrible experiences with hotlines, ours is awful, and I’ve been talking to my therapist about the possibility of starting our own local one. I wonder if it’s okay to post a Google Forms survey about people’s past experiences with hotlines here, with totally anonymous answers so we can see what’s most important for callers. I know what matters to *me* but I can’t base a whole idea of my sole feelings. Thanks.

"every time i make a mistake, he takes it out on my momi am 15m, a very flawed person, and to be frank, i fuck up all the time. specifically my life skills are very underdeveloped because of how my parents raised me. my dad blames this on me playing video games and whenever i make a mistake usually related to life or any small thing in particular, he’ll take it out on my mom. he’ll yell and scream, threaten to kick her out or smash my things if hes super angry, but most hurtfully he’ll degrade my mom, brother, and me. this led to me and my brother having depressingly low self-esteem and self-worth, leading to me becoming a cutter and my brother developing an eating disorder. i want to end my life often so that my mom doesnt get verbally abused... i’m too socially awkward to go anywhere in life anyways, and I’ve done everything I’ve wanted to do (by the age of 15 believe it or not).",2.0
"Hi. Not sure if I belong here, maybe you guys can help me figure that out.So, today marks the anniversary of the suicide attempt I made last year. Historically a bad time of year for me, also marks the 5 year anniversary of getting fired from my last job, which crushed me emotionally and I've kind of been a wreck ever since. Isolated myself completely from people. Stopped taking care of myself completely, more or less. I seem to only exist to consume resources and get worse.

A few months ago, I stopped seeing my kid, because his Mom yanked my ability to see him at my place, expressing concern about my mental health. Which, of course, made my mental health worse. Self fulfilling prophecy for the win. This removed the last link I really have to the outside world. With a little help from her, I'm now back to thinking that he's really better off without me. And really everyone is. I've done a nice job the past few years distancing myself from everyone who used to care about me, so really very little damage will be done. My landlord can keep my security deposit, and the world will keep on spinning, with no change at all.

The past couple of days, I've started thinking of suicide again. It's almost scarier this time around, because I'm not particularly in any sort of emotional crisis, unlike last year. It feels like I'm getting close to rationally making the choice to go through with it. Life was never very good, and I have every reason to believe it only gets worse from here. It's gotten worse every year for at least a decade. I just kind of want to punch my own ticket and call it a day.

I've got a head full of bad thoughts. Probably because I have some childhood abuse in my background. Been to therapy here and there. Not going back. They always try to build up my self esteem, then get frustrated with me and start hinting that I should just get over it and get a job, because I'm clearly capable.

Any thoughts? I'm getting really fucking tired of trying to convince myself that continued existence has any intrinsic merit. Maybe some people just get a bad hand in life due to circumstances and the genetic lottery, and I'm one of them. I'm getting more comfortable with the idea all he time. No one has ever seemed to really give a shit about what I'm dealing with. My family basically didn't bat any eyelash when I tried to kill myself last year. I'm scared that this is the last time I will attempt to reach out, at all.",2.0

I've been depressed for over 2.5 years now (but not diagnosed cuz my parents dont allow me to, so I guess it doesn't matter anyways) and have come to the conclusion that the best way for me would be hanging. The first rope I bought in winter 2018 I think but the first time I brought it home (I'm in a dorm during the week) I forgot to hide it, so my mum found it in my schoolbag but didn't talk to me abt it, I just never saw it again after that. The second one I bought like one or two months after that n since then I basically plan on every goddamn weekend. And I just find myself crying on my bed at 3am, reminded of how much of a baby I am. One time I tried to hang myself in the bathroom in the middle of the day, but as I felt the noose around my neck, I could hear my parents talking in the kitchen and I just couldn't do it. I just couldn't let them find me this way. 

The second more or less real attempt happened just an hour prior. Both my parents were and still are not at home. I got everything set up in my room. I stood on the chair. I just had to kick it away, that's all that it would've taken. I chickened out again. Everytime. Now I gotta embrace at least another week of failing. Disappointing anyone.

"My life is hanging by a threadI was a grown in Jehovah's witness, my parents got in this cult when I was two years old and they started to fade out of it when I was approximately 13. Problem is, you can't simply get out of a cult that quick. At 15, when my father died, I was thinking I would come back one day or the other because I still believed all their shits. As a result, I was filled with anxiety and fears and I was socially impaired. Anyway, I still wanted to come back because two of my older sisters were (and are still) in the cult and it's not that easy to remove all the crazy thoughts they implant in your mind. The reason why I didn't come back was because I wanted to go to college, so I did and I learned tons of things especially regarding logical fallacies. I decided I did not want to come back but I was still (and I'm still) filled with anxiety. I have to take medication to alleviate this anxiety and right now, I don't even have the money to buy those pills. They ruined my life and my life, right now, is going down the drain. I'm just a 32 years old guy filled with anxiety and social phobia, out of job and money. In fact, I received a letter today telling me that my unemployment insurance may be cut. Everyday, it's becoming darker and darker and I'm slipping into depressing thoughts. When I was 28, I had the hope I could become a social service worker, so I got a degree (doing it part time) and I worked for 4 years. But now, in 2015, I tried to get a new job, jobs are available but every time I'm called for an interview, they tell me afterward that I'm lacking self-assurance. So, here I am, with more anxiety than ever because I don't even know if I'll be able to buy milk.

Making matters worse is that this guy basically checks all the boxes on shit that makes me insecure - tall, douchey rich guy (in contrast to me - 5'8"", not at all douchey guy with a good but not incredibly glamorous career). Anyway, these pieces of information - that she pretty much opened up to me sexually only when she felt threatened by another woman, and that she has clearly been with other guys who she's had much more sexual interest in than me - pretty much led me to the alternate hypothesis that it wasn't the vaginal pain and the birth control so much as her lack of attraction to me in comparison to past boyfriends.",1.0

Comfortable with deathidk if I’m the only one that feels this but I’ve realized that I’m not afraid of death but rather what would happen to those around me after I die. it’s weird cause I had a hunch from a young age that I wouldn’t make it past 30 but as I grew older that statement just got more true. I guess maybe I’m ok with not making past 30 cause at that point nobody really talks to you so you can sleep forever in peace.

"Little ways to revitalize your routine.Recently, I've realized just how important variety and freshness is in everyday life. I know that many of the tips I will list below are not possible when you are in a particularly dark place, but I thought I'd mention them anyway — perhaps something will be of help to you. Here are a few things that help me keep overwhelming bouts of anxiety and ideation at bay: 

* Push yourself to wake up a little earlier. Stretch slowly with deep breaths and take a walk around your neighborhood as the sky turns rosy-yellow. Try to appreciate the new day; think of something, anything, to look forward to. Return home for a  warm shower and freshly-laundered clothes.
* Sleep a little bit earlier. Wash your sheets and buy a few soft blankets to make your bed into a cozy sanctuary. Allot time for reading or journalling to clear your mind.
* Allot time to cook simple, lovely meals. Steam fresh vegetables, cook some rice, or cut up a fruit salad of apples, bananas, and citrus. Eat mindfully and drink plenty of water. 
* Buy a well-bound journal and a good quality pen. Write down achievable to-do lists, make calendars, note groceries, thoughts, haikus —  anything. Put your thoughts in ink; appreciate daily observations. 
* Reorganize your space, or at least a little section of it. Listen to a nice podcast as you do so. Put your sheets and pillowcase into the laundry. Clear out your shelves and drawers, sort through everything, and replace it all neatly. Light a lovely candle and add some fresh flowers. Open a window or two.
* Buy or borrow a book on any topic which sparks even the slightest interest. Crocheting? Botany? Medieval history? Delving into a new topic just for the sake of it is worthwhile.
* Embrace non-competitive hobbies. This is incredibly important in a product(ivity)-obsessed society which devalues craftsmanship and pure interests. Activities like the following enrich your daily life and force you to set aside some time away from mandatory tasks: needle-felting, gardening, writing (poems, books, articles, blogs), painting, photography, wood-whittling, typography, graphic design, etc. Ensure that whatever you choose, the hobby involves holding the  fruits of your labor in your hands. You do not have to be ""good"" at it –  this is not a career choice. Watching yourself grow and have fun with  it is success in and of itself.

I hope you are doing well — I'm glad you are here, reading this. Wishing you warmth and support.",2.0
"I’m not seeing any light at the end of this tunnelI feel like I am broken beyond repair. I feel incredibly tired, alone and useless. 

I am stuck with a job I despise in a town I loathe. I have underlying health issues that make matters worse. Most of my friends moved out. The last one will move to another country by fall. My relationship is damaged beyond repair and my SO suggested a break in order to patch things up but I am feeling this is just a way to prolong our suffering. I feel like I am incapable of truly committing to a relationship due to past experience and trauma. I am incredibly furious to the one who brought so much pain into my life that now, more than 5 years later, I still have to pick up the pieces. There is so much more to talk about this but I can’t bring myself to say it out loud. 

I am doing everything in my power to move out but I feel it’s taking too long and I am out of patience. 

I want out now and forever, but I know that’s not the answer and this is why I am seeking for help here.  Maybe it just gets worse before it gets better. 

I am going to therapy, I am actively looking for new opportunities in a larger city in which I could meet more people like me and meet more often with my friends who live there. I know there is light at the end of the tunnel, I just can’t see it. I wish I could close my eyes tonight and not have to wake up tomorrow. I don’t want to deal with this anymore. ",2.0

So, I haven't posted in here in like 5 months because things got better. College was going well and friends was good. Last time I posted I wrote a bit about them. So let me tell you about them.

I won't use real names. So there is BH and JW, my best friends I would like to say. They are wonderful people, I go out with them a lot, play games and have some good times, I've known them for years and I wouldn't trade them for anything. There is my friend SB, I met him in college, had some drinks with him, I play games with him and we have serious chats a lot. He has helped a lot, another best friend. A lovely guy he is. There is ER, all I'm going to say is I fell in love with her, same with her towards me but she lived in America and didn't want me because I wasn't physical. There is TD, another American girl, she is lovely, sweet and amazing in every way and is trying to help me move there.
And the college lot I met in September, they are okay.

For 5 months I have been getting better. Feeling happier and everything, and all of a sudden. I feel awful. And my suicidal thoughts are coming back. I've always been full of anxiety and it is awful because I'm shit at everything. I've been stressed to shit and I want to end it, I've been played like a arsehole and want to die. 

I think I should end it. It would be so easy. I'm not needed any where, not wanted. I'm forever alone, a failure, a piece of shit and I have infected all these lovely people with myself, my mind, my friendship. So I should, want and might at least try and end my life... Again. I tried with pills, that didn't work.

So you know who I am, and if you don't then leave it like that and save yourself.

"Suicidal ideation I’ve been having the past weekI don’t find that life is worth living anymore. I was going to kill myself on March 10th, but didn’t do it. I that regret so much.

At the time, I realized I was tired of trying to find reasons to live, and tired of trying to convince myself it’s worth being alive. 

Now it’s really more pointless. There’s no point in me living.

I wish that my household had a gun so I could get it over with. Or that I had a car so I can could drive into the woods and never leave, or drive off a cliff.

I have no autonomy anymore, I’m just stuck and I feel like everything is pointless, the future I see for myself is empty 

The people I live with would be happier without me. I feel like my friends don’t care about me. I can’t do the things or go to the places that distracted me. I’m really just taking up space.

I want the relief and peace I imagine oblivion would give me. Lately I’ve been telling myself I’m ready. I’m done. I’m ready to go. 

My plans aren’t aligned to what’s reality though. In my perfect world I would be able to go somewhere and end it where no one could find the remains, I don’t want anyone burdened with what’s left.

I've been able to unzip the darkness time and time again, but now the zipper is jammed.  It will not move, and my eyes are flooded with black.  My willpower has been broken.

Those around me recite words of worry, of concern.  They tell me to think about those around me, but what about myself?  What about thinking about myself? Am I here only for them? For their peace of mind?  For my support when THEY are in trouble?

Emotion has become null, nonexistent.  I feel adrift a sheet of thoughts and memories that no longer tickle or comfort my skin.  I am numb.  My own heartbeat infuriates me, because I only maintain my existence for others.

"If the doctor says no on Tuesday to my mom, I think I might kill myself.My mom is sick with an autoimmune disease and has been since I was 3 (I'm 17 now). My whole life, I've known the disease would kill her. But a few months ago, a new hope formed. A stem cell transplant that would CURE her disease. This is moms last option. She can't have any more ports. Her disease is in the final stages. She'll die in the next year without the transplant.

We took her up to Chicago this week for some testing. She passed all the tests but one of the doctors insisted there are ""other options"" (the options he offered won't work). he may influence the main doctor to not accept my mom. If she isn't accepted, then she will have her final treatment and be FORCED onto a shittier treatment option. Her disease will spread. she will die.

I got so hopeful, that this would all end. that I could know my mom would be there for my life. I got rid of my pessimistic view of her dying. Now that I know there's a good chance the doctor may say no, I'm crushed. I can't stand this pain anymore. I might just actually do it this time.",2.0

I will write a farewell letter now and keep on me every day. Just a rant I guess. I am not special, nor have I had a tough life. Just tired that is all. Someone else could have used the comfort of life I have had way better.

"I want to dieHello. I want to die so bad. I was adopted from the foster care system in Oklahoma. My parents were very old and strict religious. I had very bad Tourette syndrome so I had to leave school and be homeschooled by myself for years. I didn't know about social justice. I only watched Christian shows, and didn't have internet until recently when I was 28. I'm divorced, and I'm trapped here. I'm traumatized by the things I've lost, the pain and what an awkward person I have been. I've spent much time alone with my thoughts. My son requires extra care in school. It's been exhausting. I also have bipolar disorder, and I forget things. I never feel like I belong anywhere. I'm empty fragments of disappointment, embarassment and confusion. Things weren't nice here. I could continue or elaborate, but there is no point. I'm trying to be strong. I'm still trying to graduate college. Love my kiddo. Things are getting harder for me to cope with though.",2.0

"Friend may be suicidal, need helpA friend of mine is threatening suicide saying things like ""I wish I had the courage to kill myself"" and similar statements. She is a 16 year old female. She has had extreme depression (or at least acted depressed, I think she may be faking it/making herself depressed for attention, but I don't want to take any chances) for about 8 months. It may have been brought on by a breakup she had or hormones and teenage angst or both. Another possible cause is the false way she thinks others see her. She has a stable, loving family life. She says the impetus for committing suicide would be because ""no one cares about her"", a statement that is completely false, she has many friends. Every time I or another friend tries to talk her out of it and say we care about her she just loops it back around to the whole ""no one cares"" thing.

"I have never been so far in such state of suicide and hopelessnessI am suffering, period. I have had lots of suicidal thoughts but never an action or force. This time, it's worse than ever. Never been so bad. I have never felt so hopeless and taking a decision to suicide. I found myself planning my suicide. I found myself for the first time in my life taking a conscious decision to end it all. I write this with tears flooding off my eyes. My heart racingly pounding. I feel alive no more.

Never went from ""optimistic no matter what"" to ""total hopelessness and disbelief in life"".

Nothing is the same for everybody. A situation that might seem nothing to you can be a traumatic experience.

I feel no more. I don't live in a region with suicidal Hotline and can't afford a therapist either. My only choice is to dump it all here until we see who wins the fight : **Me** or **Suicide**.

# Please listen to my request
If you see someone, he might seem male and masculine. He might seem large. He might seem fit. But don't let that distract you. He's clearly open with you. You know from his way of interaction that he might be autistic or with SAD. Doesn't matter he's very weak and fragile, you know that. No matter what he does, do not hurt him. He's so fragile and he's so open about it. An action towards him can actually terrorize and traumatize him. The kid is so fragile, that he can be abused and manupilated by kids years under his age. It's all clear and y'all know it. That kid can commit Suicide so easy. Don't prejudice his weirdness or large body. A body that he didn't choose doesn't mean he can actually use his body. Don't face that kid with Toxic Masculinity, **you're a man**, **men are strong**. Never hold anything against that kid. ",2.0

"Fucking suicide dude..I’m suicidal. I want to die. I can’t do it because people would be sad. That kinda makes me mad. Why should I suffer because people care. Very selfish. I know I am. I’m only a man. I’m not some god. I can’t make the bad people go away. They’re in my head. They want me dead. My dad is sick but I’m afraid to talk to him. It’s been a few years. We were never close. It’s as if he already died in my mind. He’s close to it. Stage 4 everything cancer. Stuck in a hospital bed close to death. My mom is healthy enough, she smokes.

I want to make people happy, make people laugh. Now I’m optimistic but I know it won’t last. I switch from personality to personality like the flip of switch. I hate, I love, I want, I’m done, and I’ve begun. Crazy. That’s how I’d describe myself. I need help. I’m hoping Bernie Sanders wins so I can see a doctor. I don’t feel safe, for myself or others. 

If the bad men take control again i might hurt. I don’t want to. I need help. Should I try the state mental health facility? They aren’t very helpful. I seem to come out worse when I go there. It’s in Kansas City. They put you all together in a room. The people there make me feel sane because they’re all fucked up in the brain. I’m just depressed and extremely stressed. I’m worthless and I’m the best. Maybe bi polar but I think it’s worse. I’ve been diagnosed as schizophrenic, once or twice. People here in Kansas aren’t always nice. Some are cool until they find out you’re mentally fucked up. They treat me like I’m crazy but I guess that’s fair. I just want to be normal but life scares me. I’m afraid to leave my room. Help.

"Roommate's gf acting strange - should I be worried?Hey SW, this is the only place this made sense to post. I wish this could be someone else posting, but she's not that lucid right now. My roommate's gf has been acting really weird (hallucinating, nonverbal, pretty much catatonic). She's diagnosed with OCD and on meds and everything, and I know they've recently changed her meds. To be honest, I don't know if she's taken a single one and this is some kind of Seratonin-storm-like kinda thing, or if she's been taking them and this is some kind of interaction. I just caught her with a handful of Motrin that she tried to sneak into the bedroom, but when I caught it she was smiling and mischevious, not exactly what I'd call suicidal behaviour.

I've known this girl only a few months, and she's definitely eccentric. She sleeps 14-18 hours a day, sometimes more, but she always seems to get her homework done, so until now, it's been a non-issue. Now, that laziness, combined with the new behaviour, is threatening her final exams, her GPA, and pretty much her entire academic career.

Her boyfriend / my roommate is at wit's end. He's got his own shit to deal with, and he has no idea what to do. It's shocking how fast this onset, best-case scenario this has all started over the last 12 hours. That's the only reason I'm so confused. My roommate won't doubt her, and I've offered to take her to the ER if we feel that her health is in danger. For now, she's made it out to the sofa, but she insists that she bring her gerbils with her. She's still (purportedly) seeing aliens everywhere, and will only communicate via text message. Does this make any sense to anyone? Should I be worried?

EDIT: Thanks for the advice, everyone. She's currently in a Concentrated Nursing Unit under 24h surveillance, and they think this is just a bad reaction to the Prozac. Apparently the symptoms gradually appeared, and it took a drastic change in her behaviour for us to notice, and I feel terrible I didn't investigate sooner. She's no longer scared or anxious, and everything seems to be under control.",2.0

Brief history... The last few years... I took care of my grandfather alone in my 20s and watched him slowly die... A year after he passed my dad committed suicide.... I packed up my life, put it in storage and moved to the other side of the world... my mum called a few months after I arrived to tell me she has terminal cancer. I came home watched her die the most horrible death you can imagine everyday for a year and a half. I'm an only child... I have no other family. I moved into her home after she died, surrounded by her things....in a small town that is a ""retirement community"" (I'm 30 btw), while I figure out what to do with my life. Not long after my mum died the woman that I thought I was going to marry broke up with me. She thinks I'm an asshole who can't deal with stress and has a lot of bad luck... Tonight...it's my birthday, I bought myself a new phone, tried to transfer everything over, deleted everything on my phone, including the backups... All the photos I took with my mum before she died are gone... Spoke with tech support they told me to update my computer... It crashed... I'm going to a wedding tomorrow (alone) and ran over my dress with my computer chair and tore a huge hole in it. I'm sitting here staring at the blank screen that was my computer... With my dress in my lap... In a room full of all the things that dead people left me... Wondering how the hell it all went so wrong. I'm losing my mind.

I hate that I let them down and that I’m not a good enough kid for them, but the thing that I hate the most is that I don’t really care. I guess what really started this was how unmotivated I am in everything. I’m failing all my classes and I just lay in bed all day eating and sleeping. I dont even talk to my friends anymore, not even my best friend of 7 years. I just want everyone to leave me alone, I want to be by myself and not think about anything at all.

"I finally told someone todaythat I realized I just don't want to be alive anymore.  Everything I ever thought I was looking forward to has been taken away, or I lost it, and it just doesn't seem worth the effort anymore.

I've felt like this for months.  Even though I continue living, it's mostly a show.

What's amazing is how it's possible to feel so alone and unwanted.  I'm fairly good looking.  I'm pretty skinny, but in no way am I scrawny.  I'm intelligent, if just a little quirky.  I'm finally on my way to being able to finish my education in a career that should be fairly stable.  And over the past several years I've actually come out of my shell a lot, become more social, and seemingly more adapt at approaching girls that I've been interested in.  But it doesn't seem to matter.  Sooner more often than later I'm tossed aside for something new, left alone wondering what I did wrong, and no one will tell me.

What are you supposed to do, when you lose all hope for love, all hope for honesty and goodness in other people?

When someone calls asking for help, if they say they're going to commit suicide, one of the questions you can ask is if they have a plan.  The idea is to figure out if they really have the ability to harm themselves.  I've had lots of plans.  Generally I don't want to scar whoever would have to find me, so most of the more gruesome methods are out.  But I'd also like to go out as much of a man as possible.  Is that strange?

The other option is to make it seem like an accident, so my friends and family, and all the girls I've loved don't have to feel guilty, don't have to think that they did something wrong.  But how do you make it look like an accident while ensuring that you're successful?

I’m noticing a pattern where my body is like rejecting my partner and I’m concerned it might be caused by my abuse at an early age. Should I seek counseling?

I’ve talked to therapist before but whenever the topic of the abuse arises I tense up and can’t remember anything.

Everything went to shit now. I miss her a lot, its been a year but I still feel as if its yesterday. Tried to go on but I feel burnt out.

"ByeI think this decision comes more from my logic than my depression (not that I know whether I'm actually clinically depressed or just totally aware of my fucked-up loser-ness). I've had suicidal thoughts since about fifteen or sixteen. I acted on them a few times (half-heartedly), and made one serious attempt last year but failed (I was drinking to build up the courage and fucked up and got found and taken to the hospital). I went to a counselling session, saw how much the lady didn't give a shit and never went back. I'm not going to leave a note for my friends or family. I've hid my depression well but it won't be a shock to them. My family knows I'm messed up in the head. With my friends I've tried to be more careful, but there's been plenty of times I let something slip out about wanting to kill myself when I've been wasted (I drink way too much (usually getting angry and emotional and pissing everyone off)). They've never really confronted me about it in a serious way, I'm guessing they're all just so stable they can't really get their heads around such pain and what a fucked-up mind actually is, either that or they don't really give a shit. I like the idea of saying goodbye here, to people who have some idea what its like, making this final stamp on the world that I did exist. I don't hate the world, I think its kind of cool. But you know how it is and I actually think I've done pretty well to make it this far. Half of me is sad and blubbering like a baby but the other half feels like air or something. This is gonna be really lame and clichéd but I don't care, I really like it, so if you've read this far, deal with it.

"I don't wanna be here anymoreThis is the first time in a long time I've contemplated suicide ""sober"", if you will. Typically my attempts are an impulsive action and I have to pick up the pieces afterwards.

I've been suicidal for as long as I can remember, its always been my escape route if things got too much, but this feeling at the moment is something quite different to all that. 

I just don't want to live. I am not happy, I do not make others happy, I have nothing positive to contribute and I just want to end it all. I am such a drain on others

"How many more straws can this camels back take?I spend every day in utter turmoil, I go to work 5 days a week working with shitty people for a shitty boss who lives to drain the wallets of old people. I've got nothing from school I can go on, and the one chance I had to make it into game design I passed up because I didn't think I'd have the drive to complete it. I've spent the past year of my relationship almost dead silent, don't think my girls even seen me not-high in almost 2 years, she's not been fucked properly in half that time (not by me anyhow, part of me just wishes she'd fuck someone else and find them better.) The truth is if I wasn't able to get high, I would kill myself. I won't touch cocaine and heroin because I'd probably like them too much.

Everyone around me is playing an act, I'm the only audience member to a play the size of the Earth, and every dumbfuck is taking humanity off a cliff and patting themselves on the back for doing it. I drift through each day with a cold, heartless stare that frightens anyone that makes eye contact with me. Rooms literally go silent as I walk in. Not that I really care, the small part of me that's still here enjoys watching the world burn around me.

A few weeks ago my father got drunk, broke down and let out all his darkest secrets to me, including murder and the fact my mum is messing around on him. They had a big argument that evening, I went down to stop it and he pulled a nice big kitchen knife on me. I've barely acknowledged him since, but around me my family is still playing out this oh-so-friendly act. I can recollect about 2 weekends from my childhood (shopping with my grandparents), everything else is blank.

I thought writing this out would help, but it's only confirmed how fucked I am and how much I just want it to end.",2.0

I have an elderly animal who is having some troubles adjusting to the new environment so they need some help. I am trying my hardest to make sure I am meeting my roommate demands and my animals but for some reason it has just gone off the rails. This weekend I was gone from home and received an angry text Friday. Apparently my animal smelled terrible and needed to be taken care of (keep in mind she stays in my room and does not walk around the house. Meanwhile my roommate has a dog that shits and pees everywhere, you can't even walk in the back yard and the living room carpet has smelled like pet urine far before I got here.). But no big deal. I will come home and fix it. So I did, and left again. I understand people who are not used to particular animals being frustrated about what goes along with them, and I don't expect anyone to understand everything. So fast-forward to this morning. I walk into my room and it is torn to hell. Apparently my roommates said the animal had clearly urinated and threw-up on everything in my room and it was a problem (they decided to shut the door so my animal must have been in here unable to access the bathroom and must have been scared). They clean the room and then today are now talking to me about moving out. It feels very sudden and I am SURE I seem like a total asshole but I am not too sure what to do. I'm just anxious and I feel bad because I don't want to come off as an asshole but I also am frustrated because no one seemed to tell me it was a problem until it was too late. And this is happening on top of tons of other things in my life that are just making everything else go down hill.

you've helped me before...and i think ive realized that im back to where i was...

square one...the bottom.

in actuality i dont think i ever truly left here...just pretended it didnt exist.

im considering suicide again all because of my own stupid self.

little background first:

i am a college drop out, barely make enough money to cover rent to my parents, hate my life at home, hate my relationship but cant bring myself to leave her, continually fall deeper into depression over my ex, smoke cannabis almost daily, recently was arrested, and am on prescription effexor and trazodone and neither of which help with much of anything anymore...

i dropped out in october of an overpriced school, i now owe over $5000 dollars to the state, the insitution, people, my parents, everything.

i have no car, no life, no anything.

the people in my life have done nothing but prove to me that they are only lookinf out for themselves, and even now drugs dont even help with the pain im feeling every day, regardless of what medications i put into myself to make it go away.

i feel like the only way im truly going to be happy is when i finally end it.

im terrified right now...im deeper in depression than i think i ever have been....i cant get the past out of my head. and to make matters worse: im in a house with a girl ive been seeing for 1 and 1/2 years who i didnt ever anticipate staying with after the first night we fucked...

the worst part is i know there are weapons in this house...ive walked by her fathers pistol roughly 3 times already eying it each time...i have no idea if its loaded...i dont want to check...cause i know if i do it is over...

i seriously dont know what to do with myself at this point...my life is litterally falling below the threshold of ""rock bottom"" as i type this...and i have no idea where else to turn...i cant exactly talk to the people that are causing my depression about THEM...so please...anyone...what do i do?

"İ have seen a weird dream... ( Warning please read!)İn my dream : i was committing to suicide with knife and i saw the afterlife...
İ was in the void ,where quite dark , i was really anxious and feared , i was really alone ...
And than i had regretted to commit suicide , i was aware of the fact that i missed the chance , and i will never able to go back...
And than i had seen a being , i dont know she is my highest consciousness or God than she said :   "" You made a terrible decision , you have doomed yourself , you will never go heaven.."" she said i was trapped in the  eternall darkness and deep torment for eternity...  it was a bit like American Horror Story Coven epsiode.

İf you are suicidal please know ... you are important , you are clever enough , you are fucking enough , just fuck the others , fuck the haters , no matter what your gender , race , religion is you are important man and i love you 
Please there is always hope i know it , you always can be a hero of someone else's , you can always find love , you can find happyinies , just start small , and try your best to avoid toxic environmet ,know yourself worth , just dont lose hope , sometimes you will fail only when you give up ...

"Don't know what to doSo I had been seeing a counciler for quite a while. She was great, helped me through a lot, even when I hurt myself for the first time. Now, I can't schedule another appointment b/c she is busy. 

The reason why I hurt myself twice is somewhat complicated, and I don't know the best way to describe it. I call them, ""Visualizations"". They are scenarios that play out in my head that can cause anxiety, anger, sadness, despair, or even, me to hurt myself. The scenario is always the same: Someone, usually a man confronts me while I am minding my own business and then it leads to a physical confrontation. I then see myself hurt them in violent fashion. Broken bones, faces beaten into a pulp, etc... It scares me that I keep seeing these scenarios, it frustrates me that nothing can stop them. The person confronting me is a metaphor for my condition, because I can never stop them (without violence).

Now, I do have things like my stressball for when I am breathing erratically, and my journal so I can document my visualizations, and medication for anxiety, but to no avail can I prevent them from happening.

"Gotta let this out somewhere.I just want to dump all this here because I have no other way to get it out. Tonight I was feeling severely upset and decided to walk to the gas station to buy cigarettes. The whole walk there and back all I could think about was killing myself. I've had suicidal thoughts for years and I've made a few half-hearted attempts in the past, but I always get too scared to actually do it. 

I was in therapy for about a year and on anti-depressants for most of that time. None of it seemed to help at all. I know people care about me and my life has not been the least bit difficult, but I still can't stop thinking about it. I think about killing myself almost every day. I've tried getting out more, getting more exercise, I even joined the army thinking it would fix my life. Nothing has worked. Recently I've thought about volunteering locally to fill my free time and give me something to feel good about, but my internet searches didn't turn up anything in my area and now I've run out of ideas. I really just want to know if anyone has been in a similar situation and escaped it. How the fuck did you deal with it?",2.0
"I'm going to end it tonight.~~This isn't my first time posting here, but it will be my last.~~

~~I first attempted over a year ago, spent six months in psych wards and then was released to a group home when I promised to give further treatment a chance.  I then started seeing a therapist twice a week and going to a trans support group.~~

~~I feel I've complied with my end of the bargain.  Therapy as before hasn't been useful and I long since ceased attending the support group, as I seem to be in a different place than the people there.  I've been in transition six years already living most of that full time.  I've given up already and I have not been able to muster any continued enthusiasm for existence.~~

~~I struggle daily trying to justify this continued suffering and I've grown sick of everyone's fucking little delusions to get through life.  I cannot help but feel if anyone else understood this particular misery as I do they would feel the same and to deny them of this release is inhumane.~~

~~I bought razer blades.  Efforts to cut in the past have resulted in nothing more than chickenshit chickenscratches so I think I will do what I can to get drunk before execution, and then take a shower and slit my wrists so I can exit this world as I entered it, wet and naked.~~

~~I must end this misery.  Fuck anyone who says ""it gets better"".~~

"Does everyone think about killing themselves?For as long as I can remember, I've thought about killing myself.  I have no plans of doing it or at least soon, but I feel some kind of calm in knowing I can.  

I also think about killing myself anytime something remotely bad or stressful happens. I work for myself and whenever I'm not doing well financially, my first thought is - ok, gotta kill myself. can't take this. My healthcare plan was terminated, ""ok, guess i'm going to kill myself"" I'm in a fight with my mom or bf or something, ""gah wanna die""

I've only just started seeing a therapist but I can't even openly admit this to them.  I don't think I will actually do it but there's always this lingering feeling of it.

Is this normal?  When I was really thinking about suicide and more depressed last year, my boyfriend asked if I ever thought about harming myself, to which I sort of casually replied, ""Yeah, I mean of course but I would never actually do it"" and he was shocked and told me he's never thought about it.  I seriously thought everyone thought about killing themselves sometimes. He freaked out and was ready to call 911 but I just have never been on the edge of a cliff or actually on the brink of suicide.  

Now it's been a year and I guess I'm ok but I still find myself feeling like killing myself.  But I don't really feel comfortable telling my boyfriend because I think he won't understand and will break up with me.

Gah, I can't even talk about suicide so it's like all my feelings are just pent up inside and it just makes me feel like killing myself even more because I can't do normal human things and just need to keep this facade of everything being ok.  But again, Im not actually going to kill myself.  

I guess the main thing is I don't want to bother or worry anyone with my thoughts of suicide because a lot of times they are pretty low key and I just don't want everyone to be worried all the time because it's truly not urgent and I just don't want everyone to be on the edge of their seats waiting for me to actually kill myself.

"I’m alone, hated, and forgotten about.I’ve lived a short 21 years on Earth. Each year wasn’t ever comparable to many random people I see every day. I was born with several medical conditions, I inherited the severe depression and mental disorders, and I inherited every gene that turned out to only make things worse. I’m sure with a lot of effort and push from myself that I could be where I want to be. The fact is no matter how hard I try I never can complete a task or goal.

There’s one after another mistake I made every day of my life. No matter what my options are I can only make a decision that becomes a mistake. 

I’ve had enough. I’m tired of being my own victim and other people’s target. Life is 1/4-1/3 over and all I have to show is disappointment and mistakes I shouldn’t have made.

I searched through the internet and found many sites saying it isn't worth it and to talk it out or there's always someone who cares. Blah blah blah. Same old same old. 

Then I found this and many other threads about such dark times and seeing so many people going through what I am going through is truly remarkable. I'm not sure whether to feel happy that I am not alone or sad that everyone else has to suffer the way that I do. 

I, as many others on this post I imagine, feel alone and am honestly tired of being told the same thing over and over. There's always highs and lows in life, but as of recent the highs I have now are what my lows were a mere 2 years ago.

As soon as I`m in my bed I start to think about to many things, it doesn't matter if I'm exhausted and had not enough sleep the past days.

Those thoughts keep me up for many hours, tried to ignore them and listen to music bit nothing helps. 

Now again, I went to bed two hours ago, totally tired and now I'm far away from sleep.
The whole time I'm thinking about killing my self, how I should do it and when I'll finally gonna do it.

"His price is even higher than what I was told and he said that's after a discount. I'm a college student and apart from tuition I have food and other things to fund and I thought that by paying this much I'd at least get my money's worth in therapy, but other than telling him about my anxiety and family, and having him tell me I probably have OCD and Anxiety disorder, all I seem to hear is the rates of the therapies and how it would take over a year of dynamic therapy, preferably 2 times a week, at 80$ a session, and that I should be able to commit if I want to continue. The second session he continued with this spending nearly 30 minutes saying I have 3 options, seeing a psychiatrist and taking pills, going to CBT to treat 'only the symptoms' or seeing a dynamic therapist like him for sessions which would take a year at least to see results. What's more, the second the clock ticks 50 minutes he says have a nice day and sort of kicks me out.

"My life is falling apart
It seems that things just seem to be getting worse and worse for me. 

26, recently got fired from my job, still living at home (sleeping on the couch as theres no space for me), rethinking my entire career path (this includes my 4 year degree, and 3 years working in the chosen field). To top this shit off, I got a speeding ticket last week AND I woke up this morning to a flat tire on my shitty car. 

I'm stressed to fuck, and have my parents pointing out my flaws and what I'm doing wrong rather than telling me things are gonna be fine.

I got a call from an agency today about some temporary admin work. Which I'm thinking is a good idea, take a temporary job whilst I figure out what the fuck im gonna do career wise. No point in starting a permanent job and leaving it months later because I hate it right? Then getting comments I dont need from my parents like 'I thought you hated admin work and working with people'. 

I'm just lost. I need to figure out what im gonna do because I'm not getting any younger. Changing careers is a kick in the teeth for me because I've wanted to be in my chosen field since I was 15. And then you start working in the industry and realise how shit it is and that it pays such a low wage when it asks for a degree AND experience.

Been feeling low for a while, seems that life just wants to kick me when I'm down. Just sick of it. I'm sick of trying so hard to have life just shit on me tbh.",2.0

"Am I There Yet ? I’ve arrived at last, a passenger to my own hopelessness.  My heart, a weary vessel of just over 30 years, has felt wave after wave of discomfort permeate my body, drawing me deeper, away from a world that scared me to pieces. My very being is heavy with invisible burdens, though it is not easy to remember what lightness feels like anymore. I get glimpses in my children’s eyes, those tiny blue seas that have the power to swallow despair, if only for a moment. 

But this weight is too great now. I feel a thousand hands pulling at me from the depths of my own creation. I feel precious memories with my son and daughter fade away, my once happy reflection reduced to searching whispers on the ocean breeze ‘Why did you have to leave, Dad ?’.

"I'm 13 years old and are considering suicideHey reddit. I've never really been able to talk to people about my problems, and its been tough. This is kind of a long story, but please read because I really need your help; During the summer of 2011 I started getting really depressed. People would put me down because of my bad skin and like any normal teenagers I feel insecure about my body. The depression got really bad and I would stop eating for days. After a few weeks, though, it went away. But during May 2012 I began getting depressed again, and this time I even started self harming. It got really bad and I would stop going out in case someone saw my cuts. After about 3 months my mum found out and helped me through the depression. I never really got over it though. Last month I made a ""My Secrets"" video and posted it to YouTube. The video included stuff about how I'm still really depressed and still occasionally self harm. My mum found it and confronted me about it. She took me took the doctors and they are referring me to a psychiatrist for young people (or something like that). I'm due to have my first session in a few weeks. About two weeks ago I fell out with all of my friends at school because of rumours and they are believing the lies instead of me. So now I have no one. I am scared to go to school or even leave the house. At interval and lunch I am by myself. A group of people in my year are constantly giving me abuse over the Internet, calling me a lesbian and telling me to go kill myself because I'm an 'emo freak who slits her wrists'. Over the past few days I have been heavily considering suicide, but upon researching it I am starting to get second thoughts. I'm wondering if I should speak to my mum and tell her everything and even ask about transferring schools or if I should just go ahead and commit suicide. Please help reddit, I don't know what to do. TLDR; heavily considering suicide for multiple reasons, having second thoughts and not sure what to do. EDIT; sorry if this isn't the right place to post, wasn't exactly sure

"Feel Suicidal Because of Sexual Preference and The Planet 

To introduce myself. I'm male, I have no family or friends.

And just to note, I've never abused a child. I would never abuse a child. My issue comes with my sexual preferences, which is pedophilia. I was exposed to child nudity from a young age, as most do. And had witnessed abuse once or twice. From what I can tell, this caused my attraction to children. I've been to therapy for this because, I value other lives over my own. I don't want to bring harm to anyone. What this made me realize was how others are not helped at all, let alone made aware of it. With all this stuff coming out on the internet about people supposedly being involved with rape and grooming, it makes me wonder, how can we prevent this from happening? There's a lot of focus on imprisoning people, and even the death penalty/torture to these people (which is a human rights violation). But not enough about preventing, about not committing these immoral acts.

When I realize that there's many other issues with myself and the world, it makes me begin to feel hopeless. Because nobody wants to change. Nobody wants to look past that stigma behind these issues. They don't look at it from the other point of view. Part of why I hate my life is because of my autism. It has caused more suffering in my life than anything else. This combined with my sexual preferences. It's created this hole that I can't climb out of. I have these sexual thoughts, and they are my only way of coping with it. There's no way to get rid of pedophilia.

I've done all the research I could on it, and nothing comes all. All people want to do is castrate those who have it. Or enact the death penalty. As far as I know, this gives more reasons for someone to act on their sexual urges. Especially those who have already done it once. And it doesn't solve the core issue, which will no doubt come up regardless of the percentage of cases of X.

my motivator for wanting to die is the suffering that happens all across the world. To all sentient life. It saddens me to see violence used against anyone, for any reason. I wonder if there is ever hope out there. To see change in the world. Whether it's our attitudes to certain topics, or the way we treat each other. So much injustice happens, and yet, I find myself wanting to die before anyone else.

I don't listen to violence or negativity. I listen to reason. Perhaps I have overlooked something here, which is why my will has bought me here.",2.0

"Scared of myselfI’m 22. I started self-harming as a teenager. For a couple of years I managed to stop cutting for the most part, even though I was still stressed out and would find other ways to hurt myself. 

Now I’ve slipped back into cutting again. I hate that my body is covered in scars and I’m always scared about how badly I’ll hurt myself the next time, but it doesn’t feel like something I can stop right now. 

It’s scaring me. I am suicidal. I don’t feel like I deserve to be alive and I don’t feel like I’ll ever be in any decent relationships. But I haven’t fully wrapped my mind around the concept of being dead. My self-loathing is at an all time high, but nothingness is scary, and even though I’ve never believed in hell I know if any such concept was real that’s what I’d deserve and that’s terrifying.

I’m just scared. I can’t picture myself in the future, and the right thing to do would probably be to give up now, but I can’t fully let go and don’t understand why. 

Edit: I’m broken. I’m too fucked up and no one can save me now. I know that, so why can’t I just let go? I’m such a loser. ",2.0

But originally I had these plans to use the money to better me and my partners lives. Now I think the best thing would be to transfer it to her and finish it once and for all. Just as a thank you for dealing with me and a sorry I wasted her time...

I'm just really not sure I can go much longer. I've never felt more useless in my whole life.

I’m just tiredI don’t think I can keep up with anything anymore. I just don’t see any benefits for living. I thought if I found love it would fulfill one missing aspect in my life but it didn’t and now I still want to die but now I know there’s one more person I’m hurting. I just feel so behind in my education and career. I don’t even want to make it Christmas.,2.0
"I Can't Keep Doing ThisI'm trying my best to find a reason to keep living - a reason to hope. But...I can't keep living like this. 

I feel like an absolute failure. All my close friends are married, having kids, and are years into their careers while I'm floundering aroand and unable to make things work. I'm not lovable - and I'm not just talking about romantically. I don't have any redeemable qualities; I know everyone else's lives would be better if I died. It's embarrassing to feel this way, too, since I've always identified as a Christian...but now I don't know if God even cares. I feel ashamed of being religious, and I feel ashamed of my doubts. I just...I feel like I'm a fuck up no mattet what I do.

I absolutely hate who I am and really want to kill myself. I fantasize about various methods constantly. I know my life won't get any better. i don't have any hope for myself. I just wish I had someone who'd help me end my life since I'm too much of a coward to end it all. I wish my friends understood how soul crushing it is to live a life that will never have meaning.

I'm pretty sure that I will die a violent death. Maybe crash my car. Maybe drown in a hot tub. Maybe collapse on a burning stove while frying up some eggs, then flop around on the ground while my clothes are on fire. Maybe smother myself in bed.

"failed MEPSi failed the drug test for the army despite being clean for 2 months and smoked cbd once a month from my drug test date. i was pretty suicidal before enlisting. i was hoping enlisting would give me a sense of purpose. now that i have failed i see no other career that will be worth while. i really wanted my ticket out of my shitty life in hope of moving on and being with a team. a sense of real family. it's been a year and half. now i'm stuck in my parents house. typical hometown kid. i have been thinking about the outcome of me becoming a solider. knowing i will never be one makes me very suicidal. i smoke a lot of dope before talking to recruiters. and they told me to go cold and i did. smoking weed was the only way i could be ""happy"". so i stopped in hope of being happy with a purpose. i really want to die today there is nothing for me to do. i think i might do it on halloween. I'm stuck in a hole and there is no friends and no family. i'm worthless.I AM A USELESS PEICE OF SHIT. I AM GARBAGE. the worse thing is in high high school everyone thought i was going to go to the army. now when they see me and shit i feel embarrassed and disappointed in myself. i feel like a waste of space right now. there is literally nothing else i wanted be but in the army.",2.0

I try going outside late at night and early in the morning so I can run, but there are like always people around and it drives me insane. I don't know how to maintain the motivation to be active while dealing with my anxiety that keeps convincing me that everyone is judging me and may yell insults at me or the other side of things: may kidnap, attack or murder me (since I go out when it's pitch black outside to reduce the ability to see me).",1.0

"Help with how to proceedI have had suicidal thoughts for several years now, as far as I know it runs in my family (my father committed suicide almost a decade ago). I have made the terrible choice of keeping everything to myself until now, but starting a new semester of school has pushed me closer to the edge than I have ever felt. I am afraid that I will lose control and commit suicide at some point, and I realize that I had to get help. I do not feel comfortable going to any family or friends right now, I couldn't tell you why even if I wanted to. I just want to know if there is any way that I can begin the process of getting help, and a diagnosis, as a college student without involving those around me?

"I’ve reached that point again.I told my therapist three weeks ago that I had this unnerving feeling. I couldn’t make out why but it’s best described as a waiting for the other shoe to drop. I was finally in a place in my life where I can do and afford to do things that interest me, making enough that I didn’t get food stamps (after three years of being off and on/mainly on), saw a flight to Amsterdam in Februaryfor a cheap price so I even booked that.

Was pulled into HR over an incident and basically since I wouldn’t lie to involve two other coworkers they were going to fire me. I opted to resign and left. I just can’t in good faith fuck someone else’s livelihood up, even at the expense of my own. 

I can’t even fathom going out of the country anymore if I don’t have cash. Was planning to get passport made this week. Move out of my sister’s house (⭐️) by January 1. Start working on my credit. 


Now I’m back to square one. Unemployed, depressed (with the slightest inkling of optimism), and suicidal given I just lost my cushy $3200 a month after taxes unskilled labor job.

"Getting abused by my girlfriendI was sent here from another sub so here's the same op

I don't have a desire or purpose anymore. My hobbies don't fulfill and even my dream since birth pretty much doesn't have any more allure.

My friends tell me how ugly and shit I am. They told me to go through with it when I was 16 but I was too afraid so was institutionalized instead when I told my parents. Now they continue to give me that idea, and my girlfriend does too.

She keeps hitting me or yelling at me when I forget something or do something wrong even though I have a lot of stress between working and being a math major so I sometimes forget to get the right stuff from the store. Last time she threw a knife at me and made me cry because I forgot to get her new tampons on the way home from a 16 hour day.

She keeps telling me how shit I am as a person whenever I do these mistakes and it pushes me to cry almost every night. I try to work hard and be a good bf but I can't necessarily always keep everything in mind and deal with everything that's on my plate.

Clearly I am worthless and these people want me to go, so I will. I just want to know how I can minimize their suffering in the aftermath.

"I'm so close...and I have no one...I don't know what to do anymore....
I'm not sure where to start. 
I'm failing to see the point in living anymore..
Me and my husband are on the brink of divorce, for various reasons. 
I work a full time job 40-50 hours a week, on my feet, and while I love it it's hard work, the pay isn't the best but it opens up doors for better things in the future. 
My husband refuses to put me and the kids as a priority, or even to realize that he doesn't I'm often alone with them on-top of working, and trying to juggle cleaning the house, and everything else. He has been very straight to the point in saying that I will never be a priority, or even worth it. Despite my numerous attempts in trying to make things better I always fail. His friends and hobbies will always be more important...
I can't afford to live on my own as I'd have to choose between rent and daycare, and my children would never have any of the nice things they are accustomed to now. 
My children also don't listen to me most of the time, and are following in suite of there father calling me lazy, etc. Despite the fact I have very little down time, as I'm constantly trying to clean, cook and make things better for everyone. 
Theres a lot more to the situations. 
But I've hit a wall with the latest fight between me and my husband....I'm not sure how much longer I can hold on....the thought that everyone is going to be better off without me is always there
And if I died my children would have everything that they are still accustomed too because he makes far more then I do. And if I'm gone he would then have to step up and he the father that they need.

You are probably thinking that im just an attention whore, or that i feel like that because i hit puberty, the time where you meet your first problems. But i dont think thats the case. Here's my story. So i moved to another country a year and a half ago. I had to learn a new language, go to a new school and find new friends. i did not manage to do those things due to my social anxiety and being alone everyday made me depressed. Im wondering why im keep trying since everyday is the same. why am i even living? when i think about it im always thinking about suicide. But i dont really want to do it cause i dont have the balls to experience such a painful thing. But if i dont do it im gonna be depressed for life. i am going to school to get a job and earn money to feed myself but i dont feel thats worth doing when im already tired of waking up at 7 am everyday. What do you think? Is it just puberty? thanks for your time",2.0

"I'm not sure if I'm suicidal or just too ashamed of myself to keep livingI'm a 25 year old PhD student in biology, obvious throwaway account. I just finished my second year of grad school, and I absolutely hate it. I feel worthless and like I can't make a difference or have any impact on other people doing the job I'm doing. I study animal behavior, and I am alone all day in a tiny, dark room watching animals to eventually write and publish a paper that \~7 people will read. It's all so pointless. I came to grad school because I wanted to be a professor\- now I can't see myself doing anything involving teaching or research. It's so hard to get through to students, research is brutal and lonely, writing grants is awful, and all the professors I know \(including my advisor\) are either insane and insanely stressed out. Like, to the point of not leaving the lab until 10pm every night and coming back at 6 in the morning. And the job market for PhD's is soooo bleak... and none of my friends or family really understand what I do as a grad student. I try to explain my daily life and I just get confused looks. 

I've realized recently that I should've been a nurse. I think I would've been happy in that career\- learning about science but still having human interactions and maybe feeling like I'm making  difference. But I feel trapped, like it's too late for me to change careers. Last time I tried to drop out of grad school to do something different, my advisor cried and begged me to stay. I'd be fucking her over if I left. Meanwhile, I'm watching as my friends from college become doctors, lawyers, nurses, veterinarians, successful chefs... I want to be happy for them, but all I feel is bitter jealousy. I had to stop talking to my best friend from college because he is just too successful now. I feel like I must embarrass him. I think I'm smart enough that I could've been something good, but instead I made a bad choice and came to this grad program. I don't even know why I did it. I was just blindly following a path that I thought I wanted, without really considering whether or not it was the best choice. I want to drop out so badly, but I don't think I can. So I feel trapped and I want to die. I deserve to die, too, because I'm 25 and I feel like I haven't accomplished a single thing. Which I know sounds ridiculous\- but it feels that way because I haven't done anything I'm passionate about. ",2.0

I can't call a suicide line without being overhead, so that isn't really an option (my dad is unemployed and he will hear me). 





I initially I had thoughts on suicide, but didn't think of doing it. But now I'm determined to end it.

"Best way to shoot myselfWouldn't shooting down through the top of my skull would cause a more destructive wound?(compared to the mouth, side of the head, or under the chin?). I've also heard that aiming at the back of your head through your chin, with a mouthful of water is even more effective than either of the normal methods. Because if the bullet fails, the bullet travelling through the water produces a large shockwave as a failsafe(said to be like a shotgun blast when using large bullets?)

The brainstem is only slightly further away when you're shooting downward at it, so I don't see any reason it'd be much harder to aim at. Is the top of the head simply too thick for the bullet to travel straight, even with large caliber guns? During longer bullet travel to the brainstem, a large hollow point bullet will expand more, causing larger wounds, right? So is there some reason I've never heard of anyone shooting themselves downward through their skulls, or water in the mouth?",2.0

And i mesesd up a lot, but i tried to fix my friendship with her as much as i could, and i tried to never do anything to make her mad. I was so scared to make her mad at me. I dont like fighting. But she said bye to me like i was... garbage. That i never meant anything to her. That what she meant to me, was not the same for her EVER. 
This hurt is immense. I already have depression, because i have severe social anxiety disorder, and i have family problems. I dont know what to do. I dont want to let go. I dont want to lose her. I need help. PLease someone out there, what do i do.

"There's nothing life can offer me would make living worth it.I'm 22 years old, diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.  I tried to kill myself by overdose last Christmas but landed in the psych ward instead.  I self-harm fairly often.  Sometimes that has kept me from trying to kill myself because I go numb when I cut.  In the past couple years I've been in and out of the hospital.  I spent 6 months in a partial hospitalization program before they gave up on me.  I've been in a mentalization based therapy program for the past year, but it hasn't been very helpful.  My family thought it might help if I got a psychiatric service dog, but I can't because one of my flatmates is deathly allergic to dogs.  It doesn't seem like any amount of therapy or medication has made me want to stay alive.  All I can do is cut to distract myself from wanting to die.  

I understand that there are a couple of people that would be hurt by me killing myself, but why should I constantly suffer just so a couple of people can go about their happy lives?  If they want me to be alive so fucking bad then they shouldn't leave me when I need someone the most.",2.0

"Today is the first day of my last daysI am giving up. I have fucked up too hard for too long and I don't want any more chances. I don't want anyone to feel sorry for me. I don't want any one to be angry with me. I don't want anyone to love me or be happy for me.  
I have nothing left for myself but despair and self-loathing and I can't comprehend anyone looking at me with anything but that same loathing and hopelessness. Any positive emotions people claim to feel for me are for what I pretend to be, not who I am. I have lived my life a lie-- acting like I'm worth something when I'm not.  
Now I know there is nowhere for me to go. Any future I might have had is no longer worth living. The worst part of it is that I am fully aware of how FUCKING EASY my life should have been.  I am spoiled. I am selfish. I am surrounded by good people and I should be happy. I am disgusting.  
I haven't had much to eat or drink the past few days, but today is the first day I have cut myself off altogether. If all goes according to plan I will die of dehydration in about ten days. I will likely lose consciousness before that. I do not want to be talked out of this. All I wanted was to tell someone.  
I'm sorry it had to be you.  
edit: for those who want to know what's going on, I've been in trouble with the police three times since coming to college (this is the first fucking year). I'm an atheist. I'm pansexual. I can't get a job and I have to pay for my own tuition. I struggle with bulimia. Past sexual assaults have left me unable to handle relationships. My family either does not approve or is not aware of any of this.  
I am in pain. I am tired of disappointing the ones I love. For so long I wanted to learn and grow and change myself into ""the person I am capable of being"", but I have failed again and again and now I've made up my mind.",2.0

"I feel like life's not worth it...(I'm not extremely suicidal, but I consider it a lot) My friends treat me like shit (excuse my language), my family is too defensive for me to point out flaws or really have my own opinion of anything (sometimes I feel like I don't even have a family), and I have trouble with my crush so I feel like I should just give up.

I feel like no one really cares about me. From my friends clearly hating me and finding my existence annoying, to my family who is only ever mad or using me, and my crush which to be honest probably has no reason to like me.

I'm pretty sure I'm just a waste of breath and energy for people, so I really wish I could end it, but I'm not sure I could bring myself to do it.

It’s my life and I can do whatever I want with it, including ending it. I tried 4 times and heard it so many times. It never gets better and never will, until I die which will happen sooner or later. Besides, I never asked to be born in the first place.

The only thing I know is emptiness, self-hatred and suffering. Ever since the day I was born, I’ve been suffering because of birth condition. Then abusive parents, bullying at school. After I tried to get rid of that suffering for 4th time and failed I ran from home. I could barely survive with what I was earning and coworkers were making fun of me. Then I was almost raped, and then got into a relationship which turned out to be a big lie after 3 years. Now I’m stuck at my ex’s apartment without a job, being pushed around and told that I’m “freeloading”. Even psychiatrist who was supposed to help only cared about making money by prescribing shitty pills that didn’t do anything.

At this point, I’m done. Not sure when or how it’ll end but I need to have an insurance first, just in case I’ll mess something up and survive.

I regret that I ever trusted someone like this, even though I knew in the beginning it was a mistake. Humans are monsters and I’ll make sure to not trust them ever again.

"it's time, but it's terrifyingEvery time I get close to the point of no return, I suddenly think, ""I don't want to die."" So then I start crying and pull back, and then I remember all the reasons I don't want to live. I don't want to die or live. The pain of living will last longer and ultimately be worse, but dying is so hard.

The reason I am suicidal is because of losing my job and then doing all sorts of terrible things, which I will not bother to enumerate, during a state of bipolar mania with psychosis. Suffice it to say that the things I did, although not criminal, were extremely destructive to my own interests and those of my loved ones, and cannot be undone. Thinking it over this evening, if I heard that anyone else did such things, I would probably assume they were headed for suicide, because it was clearly a mortal blow. There is no way to fix all the problems I caused and salvage a life that would be bearable. The things that are holding me back are pain, fear of death, and pity for the horror it will cause my family and pets. Even so, I still don't feel like there are other viable options left to me in life. I am naturally a pretty optimistic person, but I literally can't think of any way I could improve things. I am tired of feeling sorry for myself and should just get on with it. Thank you for reading this.",2.0

"Tired of being a looserBackstory- As a child I was badly bullied, because to be honest I'm an ugly looking person. At 13 I had a nervous breakdown and tried to hang myself. It failed. Never told my parents. The abuse continued throughout school. I shut out as much as possible to survive. I never socialized. I was always by myself, to avoid being hurt.

I came to expect rejection, so I didn't even try to start relationships or friendships. I'm a 49 year old male, and I've never had a girlfriend. I lost my virginity at 42 to a random woman I met online, and now I have sex with prostitutes.

I do have a few friends, only because they befriended me. I have no idea how to make friends myself. I constantly look for evidence of betrayal or rejection from my friends, then I get depressed and angry because of the (real or imagined) rejection.
There is one woman I was able to establish a close friendship with. She's a social butterfly and is friends with everyone. But my mind perceives her other friendships as rejection of me. For example if she has lunch with others without inviting me I feel snubbed and rejected. I feel the friendship is more important to me than to her. And this is driving me crazy. Don't know if my perceptions are right or not. Am I seeing rejection where there is none?

Anyway, I'm tired. Tired of trying. Tired of being lonely and feeling rejected (real or imagined).
I don't want to die, but I don't see any reason to keep living. So, maybe it's better to just stop. Haven't I been through enough? Why keep living?

That's what I'm looking for here. Why should I keep living this worthless life?",2.0
"I believe my cousin may be suicidal (or, nearly there), and I'm not sure how to help her.Let me state that I do live half a continent away, so it's very hard for me to physically be there for her.

We used to be best friends, and as close as sisters, until last year when we got in an argument over politics and we hadn't spoken to each other since then.

She reached out to me Friday night, leaving me a voice mail message (I didn't hear my phone ring) and it was obvious from her message she was barely holding it together.

She admitted to me the next day that her marriage is on the rocks and she feels like she's at her wits end.  Her mother has told me that she's repeatedly said that she ""doesn't want to be here anymore"" and that she's doing a lot of drinking.  

She mentioned that her only support is now gone (her 18 year old daughter, who has just started college) and she's feeling lost.

I've suggested she go see a therapist, but I am not sure if I can force her (or even if I should) to follow through.  I'm very worried about her, and so is her mother.

Any suggestions you have would be greatly appreciated.  I'm trying to find some way to support her from a far distance away, and going out to see her, even for a short visit, is well nigh impossible at this time.",2.0

Life can be a cold, evil place. People are susceptible to evil. But evil cannot exist without good, dark needs light to exist.

"I can't live with my sexualityHi reddit, 

I'm turning to you guys because I couldn't tell anyone I actually know about what I feel right now. So, here is my story. Up until a few months ago I was like a regular heterosexual teenager, ogling after every woman on r/nsfw and the like. However in these past months I have lost my attraction to the female body and become more aroused by men. I'm afraid that I can't live like that. I am not homophobic and I believe everyone should be allowed to love whoever they love but I don't want to be with a man. It has always been my dream to get married and have children of my own, this brings me to why I have had suicidal thoughts recently.

How could I possibly do that to someone? How could I marry a woman and know deep inside that while I may love her in the way best friends love each other, I will never be sexually attracted to her? I am currently in a relationship with the most amazing girl I have ever met and I love her to pieces but it kills me every time I talk to her or see her knowing that essentially I'm just lying about what I really feel. 

My evenings are becoming a living nightmare, I try to convince myself I'm not gay by looking at woman (I know I'm in denial) and, without getting into too much detail, can't get off as easily so instead I do to gay porn. I then cry myself to sleep and all I can think is how much I hate myself. You only get one life and I'm stuck being gay. I would honestly rather be dead. Please don't tell me to suck it up and go and have some fun or whatever because it's not going to happen. I'm sorry but this is one thing that I refuse to accept about myself, again I would rather just end it all than live with the conflict and drama that would come from being in a heterosexual relationship even though that is what I want out of life

"gonna do it over the weekendNot really sure why I am writing this. I am a 24M who's been unemployed for 4 months and living with my parents. I went to uni and ended up with a terrible gpa and was basically rejected by my peers due to social anxiety and substance abuse issues. Have had one SO in the past 3 years and that didn't even last that long. I got Baker acted while I was at my last job and I'm pretty sure the few acquaintances I made there all think I'm crazy due to disappearing for a week without explanation. I try and go out and socialize with acquaintances but it just never seems to stick. My only real hope was going back to grad school for a fresh start but it's looking like that's not going to happen due to my poor grades in undergrad. So basically I'm stuck with no friends/ horrible romantic life, poor job prospects and severe depression. The only reason I'm still here is because I know what it would do to my parents. I'm starting to not even care about that... I feel completely helpless and I know the way to end this for good. No pills that'll just damage your organs or wrist slitting that'll just hurt and clot before it'll actually does anything. This isn't going to get any better... you have to have friends to get friends. It's not like I'm actually gonna get a decent job with a huge work gap and few marketable skills. What's the pint? I'd rather just end it now than having to repeat this cycle and be miserable for the next 50+ years.",2.0

So I luckily got them to put me on 3rd shift. Minimal contact and I still get to work for the company.

"I need everything to stopI don't know what I'm supposed to do.
I'm a junior in college and I still don't have anything I'm good at or want to be doing. I'm waiting all my time and money and energy just going through it but my family won't let me drop out. But even if I did leave, what then? I have 4 work study jobs to try to keep myself afloat but have never been able to secure a job outside of school and still have hardly anything saved up. My only friends are at school, and they live across the country when we're not there. I've nearly failed out of school 3 semesters in a row now and I don't expect this upcoming one to be any different. I can't function properly, I barely eat, and only leave my room for class and work. I've just never had anything to look forward to and regardless of whether I somehow graduate or if I finally drop out, there's nothing waiting for me afterwards. Outside of that, literally nothing in my life ever goes right. I haven't allowed myself to get excited about anything in years because it always, always goes wrong, often in the most unpredictable ways. Even my friends have noticed and completely agree that I'm a fucking living personification of Murphy's Law. I can't ever catch a break and I'm so, so tired. Take all of this and add on a shit ton of unresolved trauma that I still relive in my head every single day and that state of the world in general and it's really not hard to see why I've wanted to die for so long and now feel like I won't make it to February. The one and only thing keeping me alive is knowing that some people would be very upset and blame themselves if I killed myself, and I'm seriously contemplating cutting ties with everyone I know so maybe they won't be as upset. I never thought I'd make it past 15 years old, never mind where I am now, and have just been going through life entirely blind because what's the point in making any kind of plan when it's never going to work and I'm not expecting to be alive long enough to even try?

I've been thinking - if I do reach that point, I'll buy a ticket to St.Petersberg in the middle of winter and I'll go for a walk along the shore until I stop being cold. I'll die a silly tourist.

Lucky me, though. I merely have a plan, not quite the guts to do it. Not yet, anyways, but I figure this is a major step. A year ago, suicide was ugly, six months ago, a fantasy. A brief escape into the ludicrous. The winter is almost over.

Most of the ""friends"" I have had have proved themselves unworthy of my friendship- there are so many utterly selfish, rotten people in the world, who literally only care about themselves and their selfish happiness. And so I find myself alone! I am happy that God has showed me who people are and has removed all the fake friends in my life, except that now I am pretty much totally alone. Especially since quitting Facebook, now I have no artificial social life with people I don't know. There is such a huge vaccuum in my life that, I assume, most people who are superficial as fuck and phony and selfish just fill with other people like themselves. Being real and honest, and loving, and a good person- these things actually do  NOT win you any friends in this life, I have discovered, but rather being these things LOSES you friends! 

I'm honestly just really lonely.... I am happy I have my kids, they are the closest thing I have to friends. My husband isn't very intellectual so he provides some moral support but I even feel lonely around him.... 

I'm sick of school and of being discriminated against because of my political views and not wanting my country invaded by foreign scum.

Moving to a different country, losing friends because they found better friends, forcing myself to lose weight by puking, excessive exercising and barely eating, being sad all of the time and worrying about every bad scenario possible, being so shy and nervous that I get panic attacks at the thought of speaking to people and always being at home, has really just driven me to this point.

"I'm 28 years old.I'm 28 years old and I feel like I'm in my 70s. Nothing brings me joy anymore. Everyday feels the same. It almost feel as if I am drowning. It's hard to get out of bed or give a shit really. I have felt this way since I was 16. People always said it would get better. Well I don't believe it anymore. My 20s have have almost past me and I have nothing to show for it. There is no light at the end of this tunnel. There is no pot of gold at the end of this rainbow. All I feel is apathy anymore. I tried everything, from volunteering at a homeless shelter and a free health care clinic. I  eat super healthy and work out 6 days a week. And I still feel so weak and tired. I even tried to find comfort in alcohol.  Nothing makes me feel better. I tried taking medication and I tried talking to my friends and family. I also talked to doctor about it and they all said just give it time and it will get better. How long must I wait. Everyday feels like a chore. I'm sick of jumping through hoops. I don't really even know why I am writing this. I just finished packing all my things into boxes. I cleaned out my refrigerator and vacuumed and mopped my house. I changed the oil in my car and filled it up full of gas. I withdrew most of the money from my bank accounts and put the money in an envelope on my kitchen table. It should be enough to cover my death and more.  I have written  notes for my mother and all of my friends telling them how very sorry I am, telling them what I love about them and thanking them for all they have done for me.

"Some context: I manage a person who is young (late twenties, but when angry acts like a toddler throwing a tantrum), who is a gaslighting bully. She's well-connected at my workplace, so gets lots of support from her ""friends"" who she talks to and presents this alternative reality to them about her ""version"" of situations. This is problematic, because she also needs disciplinary action because of bullying behavior toward other staff, customers, and myself, but any movement toward that leads to a tantrum.

"Dealt a shitty hand - life fucking sucksSo I want you guys to at least understand my background:

- I am coming from a Vietnamese family (immigrant background)
- childhood was kinda rough, I am culturally adapted but people obv. still point out that I am not a true part of this society
- my father is addicted to gambling and used to steal my saved up money to feed his addiction ($1000 to be precise, I was ten)
-somehow I inherited that trait, I can't drink or play video games in moderation, so I have to completely abstain from it
- I also inherited scarring alopecia (folliculitis decalvans) from him
- But the worst of all is that I have body odor, like ridiculously thick body odor and shit breath. I smell like shit or mold and bathing or changing up my diet hasn't worked. I consulted doctors all over the country and nothing helped. I am a very clean person usually.
- Due to this condition I can't hold any jobs (gotta life by the financial aid of my parents), not even talk about having a girlfriend
- oh I also have a small dick but that is the tiniest (yikes) problem of mine
- *My life has no future due to this*. I can't ahve any financial foundation I luck out and win the lottery or rob the bank with my body odor or something lmao.
- I can't have kids because of my conditions. At least I am definitely not intending to forward those genes.

Now the contras:

- I have really good friends (like more than you would think), they are loyal, smart and winners in life. I don't even know why they are friends with me, guess I have a personality.
- Due to wanting to escape from real life, I joined a music forum back in 2010 and also happened to make friends there through IRL meetups. 20 of us meet several times each year. Hell, I even travel with some of those guys one by one and some of them are very important friends of mine now.
- I am not dumb. Got my A-levels.
- My sister looks up to me. We are really good friends and we love sharing time together. I can't do this to her.
- My mother would go through fire for me
- Which is why I just can't off myself. I would sadden so many people and some of them lost loved ones already and I don't want them to experience that pain again.


It's a tough situation for me. And I know this sounds like a pity party, but my life just has no fucking future besides being a financial burden. It is like God created me with -50 on every stat on my character. Some people like me, strangers don't because I stink. I can't have jobs but have supportive people around me. I just can't keep living like this.

"Everyone is better off without me.I'm at my wits end. I honestly believe I have some form of bipolar disorder or something is wrong inside my head. I get mad and i get mean and i cant turn it off sometimes and i hate myself. I know my husband is fed up. Ive been with him for 5 years and honestly his dog is on my last nerve. His dog is older (11) and ive been in this dofs life for 5 years but because I didnt help raise him he doesnt listen to me. I get frustrated when no one listens because I feel like my parents always brushed me aside and never listened to me. When the dog doesn't listen I get a bit pissy and my voice gets snappy. Well the dog ran on me at 1am the other day when I took him out and when I lunged for his collar he rounded on me and his teeth scraped mt wrist up really good. I called my husband while he was at work (he's military so he works long and weird hours) crying and shaking because my wrist was throbbing and bleeding a bit from where he actually broke skin. My husband asked what I did this time? I broke down and told him ""I'm tired of being 2nd to your dog! I'm sick of always being to blame because of my emotions. I hate your dog!"" This obviously made him upset and i instantly felt like the worlds shittiest wife and pet mom. I don't hate dogs. I've been raised around dogs my whole life and love them. Admittedly I am more of a crazy cat lady but I love dogs. I'm just frustrated and now my depression is even higher because my husband won't talk to me or respond to my texts. (I dont blame him).

Last week I truly broke and walked out to my husband holding his gun to my head and told him he's better off without me. He lunged for me and knocked the gun out of my hands and held me. He's hidden both guns since then and I'm afraid of myself. I want to hurt myself to take shut my head up. I hate myself, I hate my life, I hate/love this dog, I feel like my husband is getting sick of me and i just dont know what to do anymore. I feel like im going to hell or whatever bad afterlife there is because I hate this dog and i verbally lash out at this dog and lose my temper. Am I bipolar? Am I a bad person? I don't know anymore.

"How do I die?I want to die, but I can't seem to kill myself. 

For over a decade I've struggled with depression. I have fought to be here over and over again. I am exhausted. I am tired of climbing up a hill only to never get to reach it's peak before sliding back down. 

I am a terrible person and need to change for the better but do not have the motivation to do so. 

I broke up with my boyfriend of five years. I let a coworker move in with me. I let myself fall in love. I let myself get my heart broken. I let myself be used. I used others. I let the anger and hatred I have for myself bubble over into everything I have. I lost my best friends. I'm going to lose my job because everyone hates me there.

I am a loser. I'm 26 and I'm alone, broke, depressed and bitter. I can't drive. I have to rely on friends and family for everything. I cause more problems than I could ever hope to solve. I have never made a single person's life better from being in it. Not once. 

I have been suicidal on and off for years. So often that the thought is almost comforting at this point. But I have never wanted to die more than I do right now. And I'm a fuck-up when it comes to suicide, too. I can't commit. I don't have access to a gun and I'm too chicken-shit to take pills or to try hanging myself. If it doesn't work, what then? To have failed at life is too much, what would it feel like to have failed death too?

I want to die tonight. I haven't never known what I wanted more clearly than this. And yet I feel trapped by my own cowardice. I have always been the maker of my own nightmares. Why would I ever think this would be any different, right?

I don't know what to do at this point. How do I die?",2.0

She'll get to the point where she's in tears and HAVE to go to the hospital because she's tired of being in pain, but they think it's all in her head.

Because of all this, she feels hopeless. This is her message.

"Feel very depressed. Should I move with a friend?will soon be graduating and this is huge conflict in my family. I have father and my narcissist mother. I wanted to go abroad for studies after I graduate high school but my mother did everything to sabotage my plans or at very least that's how the things form. I wanted to do that since I was in 5th grade and all the time I get mixed responses from my mother. Sometimes it was ""do whatever you want"" , sometimes she agreed, sometimes she didn't, sometimes she acted like she doesn't care. Recently we discussed it and she yelled at me and said she will cut me financially. Maybe I am the one that is crazy but I think that's quite a blackmail. She can use that with everything. Anyways going abroad for studies was big goal of mine and I feel depressed it won't happen. On the other hand I always liked history and I even won history competitions.. she doesn't like that too. It's another thing we fight for often. It's not even normal arguing imo. Why she even wanted to have kid? . I also wanted to learn languages and I even spoke to her to let me take German classes with a teacher (not expensive ones) and she gave me mixed responses for that too, then refused. I feel very tired from it. I live in not very good country in EU and I just wanted better education and future. I am straight A student that never did bad things..I feel like a delusional person..I don't even think I am gonna be accepted abroad with such sabotaging and blackmailing. I met cop recently and gently explained my problems and they said they don't see issue even when I said my mother used to slap me sometimes when I was child....Many young people went abroad for studies/ work and I am gonna be here stuck. I don't even know why I post that. I have one pen pal from Germany that suggested me to live with them. I know this might sound stupid to you all but I was wondering to accept it. I know it might sound crazy or stupid but we knew each other for years and talked to skype and we could meet in person too. I have some crush on him too. My mother makes everything problematic though. She seems unbalanced and always tries to force her opinion on me. She said it's because she cares and worries. Eh. It looks like some sort of mad obsession. I don't even know why I post that here...Perhaps to heal my pain. I am sorry If I sound crazy maybe my mother is right for me",2.0

I will cry randomly throughout the day hoping that something bad will happen to me so i dont have to feel this way anymore. A freak accident is better then ending it myself because everyone will question why i did what i did this. The burden that would fall upon my family is too much and i can't do that to them, but I also feel terrible telling them everything is ""fine"". Every day these thoughts manifest in my mind more and more. I dont know how to approach my family about anything because I dont want to inflict mental anguish on them or make them think they did something wrong. Thats simply not the case, as all this has been because of my indecisiveness and lack of purpose in this world.*

"No identity [19m]I don't know who I am, and I have no idea how to learn about myself. I have no social skills or friends, I'm very awkward with everything I do, and I feel like I'm just put together wrong at a very deep level. I can't say a single positive thing about myself, because I simply don't have any reference inside my mind for what's good and what's bad. I've never had anyone ever say anything really nice about me, and I've never really known myself to be good at anything. I only feel the echos of all the nasty invalidating things people have said to me for as far back as I can remember. I constantly seek approval and help because I don't feel like I can trust myself with anything. I've spent the last 5 years just trying to be OK with myself and not be constantly depressed and anxious and coming out of that I'm quickly finding that I don't know how to be happy, and I don't know how to see the good in the world. I view the world as a fucked up and cruel place where I can't trust a single person with anything. I'm emotionally grayscale, there is very little positivity in my life. I'll either be anxious, frustrated, or hurt. I guess sometimes I do feel maniacally happy but that always has a negative spin on it.

I've taken up meditation, and I've done it quite extensively (10-120 minutes a day for 4 months). It really cleared up my view of the world. It hasn't really changed the views I have of myself though. I've hit a point with meditation where I see where I went wrong in life and what I missed. I didn't ever attain an identity and I stopped growing socially in 7th grade. I didn't ever find any interests or hobbies, I didn't ever make friends, I didn't ever connect with another person emotionally. 

I feel like I'll always just be catching up. I'll always be wandering through this emotional fog trying to grasp anything to make my new identity. I'll always be looking over my shoulder, I'll always think in a scale of gray, and I'll never be OK. I feel like I've reached the highest point of joy and liberation my personality can support. I feel I've peaked, at a very low height. The only thing I know for Sure I'm good at, is being unhappy and questioning reality.

I want help, I want to change. I really really do. It just looks like I'm in such a state of disarray and malignant that I'm past the point of no return. 

TL;DR

I can't stop asking questions, nothing makes sense to me. I have this deep sense of inferiority/invalidation that goes back well over a decade and that's all there truly is to my identity.

"Discussing life insurance, mentioned mental health, was informed that it was fucking weird and I needed to shut up.Yesterday, I was discussing with my husband of 2 years that if I die, he should have enough in my life insurance to pay off everything and have a good amount to live on for a year or two with no income. I mentioned that it’ll also pay out if I committed suicide (as long as there have been no changes for at least 2 years, my life insurance will pay out for suicide, I checked). 
Husband doesn’t have mental heal issues. Never has. And that’s great for him, I’m glad he doesn’t feel like I do. But when I mentioned that no matter what (accidental death or suicide) he’d be ok, he kept telling me to “shut up, it’s weird that [I was] talking about that” and that people “don’t talk about that, it’s fucking weird”. 

I feel like it hit me twice. Like one: because I’m just trying to make sure he’s ok financially no matter what, and two: it might have been nice to talk about things, like maybe I wish I could have told him that these invasive thoughts are everywhere and I can’t keep them locked away because it’s too hard but I can’t talk to a therapist because I’m afraid of them forcing me into a 72 hour watch.

"I want the sadness to endHello, r/SuicideWatch

So, I'm a 17 year old high school student who has been contemplating suicide lately.

For the past 2 years, I've felt depressed almost all of the time. I can't pinpoint any external factors in my life that might make me feel this way. While I've never been officially diagnosed with clinical depression or anything, both of my parents have, so I believe it's not too far fetched at all to say I may be genetically predisposed for it or something.

Some stretches of time have felt harder than others. This past week is one of those times. I've had trouble getting to sleep, I've woken up late or early every day, I've had trouble focusing, I don't feel engaged in anything I do, I can't get myself to do any school work, and I've cried for at least half an hour every day.

The worst of it all has been the suicidal thoughts. I've unwillingly visualized myself killing myself in various ways. The thoughts are simultaneously terrifying and liberating. I don't think I have the nerve to act on them, but I worry sometimes.

I've been taking medication (generic Lexapro) every day and meeting with a counselor for an hour every week. Both of these have a positive impact for sure, but I don't know that they're enough. I still feel hopeless sometimes, like my life isn't worth living. I feel miserable.

The worst part of it is that I feel like nobody would really notice if I did kill myself. I feel like those who would notice wouldn't care all that much. My mom gets mad at me when all I can do is mope around the house. My dad rarely sees me and never seems to take my depression seriously. One of my little brothers seems to despise me at worst and feel neutral towards me at best. The other is a real sweet heart, but said to me earlier today that nobody loves me. That got to me. All of my friends except for one have grown really distant from me over the past year. The only friend I have who makes me feel wanted and loved by somebody has been out of the country for about 9 months, and won't return home for about 9 more. I don't know if I can last that long. I miss her so much.

I honestly feel like I want to die right now. I want the sadness to stop. I can't handle it. I feel worthless right now.

Sorry if it seems like I'm just seeking attention, but I'm hoping getting this off my chest will help. Any advice, support, comments, etc. are appreciated a lot.",2.0

So hard, over these last couple years to be friendly. I've wore a smile on my face in my darkest days. I encouraged others to success. I've tried hard to fight this endless battle in my mind.

Nothing  has brought me happiness. I can't take it anymore. I want to end it all, so badly. I do. I can't. I don't know. My mind runs at a million miles per hour. I want to live a normal life. I want to be friends. Maybe I'm just not meant for this place. I want to go grab a bite to eat with friends. I want to go climb that mountain with my friends today...

They didn't even invite me.

I've tried hard to be friendly. I know I make mistakes. I know I have my faults. But really? Is this world so pointless and dark that I'm meant to be alone. Is that really my destiny?

I think it is.

I've struggled with these thoughts for twelve years. Twelve fucking years I've fought to be better. To be normal, to be the person people wanted and expected of me. But why? It hasn't brought me friends, or the feeling of being loved. 

I'm alone. I'm sad. I'm insane.

Why do I even bother, why should I? What's on the other side? Nothing, great I'll be used to it. But what if there is something? Awesome, maybe I'll be tortured for all enternity because of who I am..

"So I have been suffering from chronic anxiety for eight years.The kind where you feel some enemy is breathing down on your neck always.I don't want to get into the details of this matter because it's is very personal.

During these last five years I have suffered bone TB, now stomach gastritis for three years,also found out I have recurring kidney stones in my left kidney.Before all this begun I was relatively healthy without any complicated disease like  bone tb or stomach gastritis.

"School is depressingHi, I'm pretty new here. I have had some depressive episodes in the past, I thought those days were over during my last day of school a few months ago... But now those thoughts are back now that the thought of going back to school has sunken in.

I'm not really the type to take pity on myself, but last year, I did something terribly wrong, and most of my friends started avoiding me. Others  who I wouldn't consider close started disrespecting me, treating me like a retard. I've had depression even before this started happen, but it only deepened my anxiety. I even got around cutting myself once. A friend saw these cuts, she said she would always be there for me, but she left me a long time ago. Remembering her promise to me made me sad, it made me think of all the things we did together, and all the thing we could have been doing this year. I fear that by next year I would be spending social night in the corner crying, or worse, in the bathroom cutting. Sometimes I lie awake at night thinking of how it would feel to jump of the roof of my house, or the school, or something even worse. I'm too scared to do it, but every night I stay up burning my youth away, it just keeps coming to me...

I've tried looking for hobbies that can help me stimulate my anxiety, I've tried writing, but I could never get myself to finish something, I tried photography, but every photo is just another blur, I've tried photoediting, videoediting, but they all seemed half-baked, I even tried dancing but I was born with two left feet.

I just don't know what to do anymore, everyday I wake up and drag on, pretending to be happy for those who love me, but when I leave them for school I just feel like a every step I take would eventually end up in disaster.

"How do I give support for someone I'm growing to despise?Little background: Few years ago my parents got a divorce and my mom began a (somewhat abusive) relationship with someone. Last year my dad died.

Shortly before my dad's funeral it became evident to my mom that she was being cheated on and the dude was going to leave her. So at our dad's funeral my mom was crying, not because her ex-husband had died but, because her boyfriend had left her (I know that my parents marriage had ended and she didn't need to feel bad about it, but to me it was extremelly disrespectful to me and my siblings --- at the moment nobody knew why she was so sad). Few days later, we were stil mourning our dad's death and the reason for her sadness showed up...

Now because her boyfriend have left her she is treatning to kill herself. Jesus Christ, My 50 years old mother is treatning to kill herself because her 36 years old boyfriend have left her!

She became insuferable, her facebook is filled with disgusting messages, posts and whatnot about how everyone is garbage and life have no meaning; she have turned away any attempt of help from any relative. She treats her 73 yo mother like shit (I believe that in her head my grandma have something to do with her being dump). She spent her new years eve on a psych clinic but isn't taking any medicine because of no apparent reason and I think that she is straight up lying to her doctors.

She is just making the lives of everyone miserable (and for me, because of the most retarded reason possible) and I don't know how to deal with it... before I try to help and just making everything worse: how do I give support if I can't stand her reasons and am in fact disgusted by it and by her actions? What should I do?

I am aware that I am the asshole in the situation for not respecting her reasons and being in general pissed at my own mother; don't need to bring that up. Or bring it, I don't know.

"I want to end my life, but I'd rather like to be able to liveMy brother and I come from a broken home. Our father was an abusive drunk, and we've never really known our mother. We grew up dirt poor, chastised and bullied in school. This has resulted into two human beings, unable to function in the society. We don't have families, partners or friends. We're unable to trust anyone, and we have only each-other.

I work a shitty dead-end job, which is nevertheless better than no job at all. My brother doesn't work. He's just too depressed to be able to. I provide for him.

We are both deeply depressed, and the level of anxiety we suffer from is beyond belief. The depression exacerbated by this loop of two people feeding into each-other's depression. I suffer heavily from having to provide for my brother, and he suffers as much from being a burden to me. My work effort is dwindling from my depression, and I'm on the verge of losing my job, in which case I would never be able to get another one, and both my brother and I would end up on the street.

We are both suicidal. This means I have to go to work every day and wonder if today I will come home to find my brother dead. It also means my brother stays home wondering if I ever will come back. We never talk about anything else than our depression and the pain and suffering we've had to go through. My brother wakes several times every night, screaming in agony from horrible nightmares. I don't dream anymore. I fall into a deep, dark coma, from which I wake every morning to the searing sound of the alarm, as soon as I close my eyes. It's like I hadn't slept at all.

I want to kill myself every waking second of my miserable existence, but I know this would effectively kill my brother. The same goes for my brother. I'd kill myself in a heartbeat if he would die. So why aren't we dead yet? Deep down it's the love we feel for each-other that keeps us alive for now. I want nothing else than for us to be able to live and love and breathe, and we can't do any of that if we're dead. It's a constant struggle, and at any moment could an impulsive act end it all.",2.0

"Questioning Life, Existence and everything else in this so far called reality.I don't know how to start or what to write, I am not even sure why I write this, probably because ""it helps to talk to someone"". Unfortunately I no longer have someone to talk with. 

I've been struggling with depression since February 14, the typical stuff I'd guess, more or less, had my first real love (No, I'm not 16.) which I found in my school after moving from my old school. Everything was going on so great until we had easter vacation, we did not see us for 2 weeks, after that, nothing. I couldn't see that there was any love any longer, just like our relationship never existed. I asked what was wrong, got a simple ""I can't say."" as response. That was it, relationship over. I was destroyed. I still felt so much love for that one single person like I never did before, but didn't get anything back. 

We saw us every day, day for day knowing that it will never be the same again, until I left the school to start as a trainee in programming. I can't complain about my job, people all nice, I program since 7 years, have a great knowledge and skills and could earn tons of money easily, yet still I'm deeply unsatisfied and depressed. 

I'm sitting here all day questioning about why not to leave this world just to remember that I tried twice and failed. First time I tried jumping off a bridge, sounds like a solid plan, unfortunately my way down wasn't as solid and I managed to survive, with barely any damage (still don't know how), didn't tell many people about that, only people I thought they were my friends.. 
The second time was will pills, but guess what, I instantly vomited the crap out. 

I still don't know why I write this or how to go on, but that's pretty much all I can tell by now. The Internet is big, I guess someone will read this at some point. I'll wait for my chance to leave this world, I won't try to suicide again, but if there will be a chance to quit, I'll gladly accept it.

"Has anyone else actively taught themselves how to commit suicide?I spent a few days learning how to efficiently tie a noose with a rope and how to properly suspend it. We have strict gun laws in the country I live in so that’s not an option but i have also spent time researching how effective certain drugs are in stopping your breathing during an overdose and the various different lethal dosages. I feel it’s important (for myself personally and only myself) that I have the knowledge and skills to remove myself from this world on my own accord. I’m not advocating it or saying that it’s a good thing to do because it isn’t but when your suffering reaches that point, you need a way out.",2.0

"Please help; Intervention, trying to find substance/depression help for a friend who is on Medicare/MedicaidMy best friend's mother is having a hell of a time finding answers for her questions, as am I, so I figured I'd ask you folks. My friend is a redditor and knows my account, hence the weirdly-named burner.

My friend is on disability and has Medicare/Medicaid for insurance. She's also severely depressed and has expressed suicidal thoughts/desires. She also has substance abuse (alcohol) issues and her family is planning an intervention, but we can't intervene and give her no options for treatment, especially because we think she's a suicide risk.

She lives in Illinois; I'm driving up there this Thursday for the intervention.

Here are the questions:

* If we take her to the ER and she voluntairly admits herself, can she stay at that hospital, or will she be transported to the state hospital?

* What kind of detox/rehab options are out there for her? The Medicare website is ridiculous and I can't find any information. It'd be safer for her to do a medical detox, and she needs help. Major help.

* How to intervention? Right now the plan is that she comes over to my mother's (she knows I'm coming up for Memorial Day, but not of our plans) for the Champions League final on Saturday (she's a HUUUUUUGE Borussia Dortmund fan, that's how we met), and then after the match I'll take her ""to lunch"", but say I have to make a stop at her brother's house (where the intervention is taking place) and go on from there. Is this OK? Right now Dortmund is ""her nugget of corn"" (whatever that means) so match has to come first.

Please help. I've crossposted this in r/depression and here",2.0
"I'm a Big Disappointment 

I'm an Asian, and my parents want me to get good grades, but two of my grades dropped to complete garbage due to some bullshit. I was supposed to get an A in AP Gov, but our teacher assigned a group project with no group evaluation. Someone decided not to do any work, which dropped the grade of our entire group to a failing grade. This dropped my overall grade by 6 points to a B, which disappointed my parents and I can't do anything to get those points back. My bio grade dropped from an 91 to an 84 as well because of TurnItIn's shitty plagiarism report. I was working with a group on the online test even though I wasn't supposed to, but I was only on it if someone needed help or if I needed help. I was already done, and someone asked me for the answer to a question. I asked him not to copy my answer word for word, but sure enough, he copied my answer word for word. This lost me 40 points because he turned his test in first while I was looking over my test, and my teacher absolutely hates plagiarism. The only subject that I'm actually good at, math, hasn't been going great either. I did pretty bad on my first two tests, and the one test that I was guaranteed to get a good grade on was three or four days before the lock down, and I was absent the day of the test. Then, I had to go on a two day field trip that ended the day the lock down started, and now, my teacher won't let me take the test because it would be in an unfair testing environment, leaving me with a shit grade in math, too. On top of this, I literally have nothing else going for me. My brother got accepted into a good school, has a lot of friends, and is succeeding there, while I'm over here doing shit in a public high school with no friends. My parents are expecting me to be just as successful as my brother, but at this point, it's near impossible. I'm not athletic or tall(I often am mistaken for a fifth grader when I'm in the ninth grade). I have very little extracurricular activities, and I don't even have a good personality to back up my failures. I just want to die at this point, but I don't even have the courage to do that.",2.0

"My plan: 14-02-2018I've thought long and hard about how I will do this! 

I can't access a gun in my country, so that's out. I tried to jump off a bridge before but I chickened out at the last minute. I wouldn't know how to get my hands on drugs. I thought for a while that I would stab myself in the jugular - pain for only a few minutes, but let's be real, I wouldn't be able to go through with it. I like cutting myself, but the thought of someone finding my body with my wrists cut creeps me out. 

For weeks my plan was to buy a rope and hang myself in a tree in the park I love, but I don't know if I could do that - I'd be scared I'd jump wrong and slowly suffocate rather than breaking my neck! 

Then I realised that if I took sleeping pills, tied myself to the tree and then just waited to fall asleep and fall out, I'd hang more easily. Then I realised an even better plan: 

I will buy whatever over the counter sleeping pills I can. I will catch the last bus to the beach that I can and wait out until 2am/everyone is gone. I will then take all of the sleeping pills and start swimming. I am not a strong swimmer to start with, and I will most certainly drown when  I nod off. The darkness will make it even harder to find my way out, so I can't back out even if I change my mind! I never grew up at the beach, so it's not as meaningful as the park/my bed, but I would rather no one can find my body. 

No one will even know I died. They will notice after 3/4 weeks maybe (at least my mum will when I stop answering texts), but she doesn't know my friends or have any contact with them. 

They might think something is up when I don't come back to uni, but all in all - they'll never even know.

I have to redo a final. My suicidal thoughts, laziness and illness prevent me from studying. I'm not doing that well in my new school. I'm addicted to energy drinks and feel bad, if I don't drink one. I drank like 6-7 in the last 3 days. I'm disrespectful to my parents. I have one crazy crush on the teacher I had in the subject I failed in. I almost only fall in love with much older people. My illness prevents me from having a love life.

In the last 3 years my life has been going down-hill and the last time I had at least a little peace was back in 2015.

Please don't tell me it'll get better because it WON'T! My illness is my main problem and it can't be cured. It's constantly there and it's killing me emotionally and preventing me from living a peaceful and happy life. I've given up a long time ago. I've always wanted to be alive and become successful. It won't happen because I have no inner peace and have lost myself. I don't know who I am anymore. I'm just floating in the air and wondering about how I'll kill myself.

I just accepted a job, that pays less than welfare, had a job interview today, hoping it would be ""the one"" to get me out of the other one. I can't afford not to work, so still going to the first one on Monday. I should hear something by Friday, if I get hired, if I don't hear anything, then they went with someone else. Most likely they'll go with someone else, seems to be the norm.

I have lost so much, and still losing. So I'm going to take matters into my own hands. No one else can tell me not to kill myself, but me. I am in control. And fuck the rest of the world.",2.0

I was reported by some of my co-workers that I have been doing my job poorly. In what way, I don't know. Maybe the pauses in between sentences, dragging out words, or arriving to the classroom 15 minutes late. I went to the principal's office and asked what exactly is preventing my potential. Told him instantly about my depression, due to some advice given to me in this website. He said that I'm faking it for an excuse to slack, or that I'm looking for attention. I just abruptly left.

It reminded me of how cruel and heartless people can be, and how worthless I am in the grand scheme of things. One thing lead to another and... read title.

"My mum called mental health servicesBecause I bought some equipment to kill myself. I went into my sisters amazon account and ordered them last night so it'll arrive today. My sister saw the email and called my mother to tell her.

I don't want to die as such. I just want to give up and stop hurting. It was a cry for help. My mum called me an attention seeker and I guess I am. 

I'm so frightened they'll admit me to hospital. A nurse is arriving shortly to assess me. Mum wants me to leave her house and has said for days she wants me out. She says I obviously need help and I'm letting my mental illnesd consume me and she doesn't want me around anymore. That I'm lazy, dirty and disgusting. 

I've been crying for days and I'm so god damn depressed. I feel completely ruined. All my family are going to find out and I feel sick with guilt and shame.

"UpdateSo recently I uploaded [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cmnfy/broke_out_crying_in_school_today/) post and I wanted to do a little update since some stuff happened that felt pretty big. 

Lets just say shit hit the fan because my moms boyfriend complained to my parents and sister in a group text chat about me not liking him. (He does stuff like this occasionally) He said I'm bullying him. I was home alone and my parents were angry at me, texting about how bad I am. They had no clue what it was like having your parents split up then having a guy move in who constantly is using self pity to get everyone to turn on you. 

I was so fucking angry that no one out there got how I was feeling and I was about to snap and finally kill myself. My sister came home to hang out while I was having this breakdown and I realized though she doesn't live with us she has been out in the world a lot and knew kids just don't like parents boyfriends who move in. We talked through my bedroom door and she got me to come out of my room and I told her I'm depressed.

Holy shit. It felt so good to finally tell someone. We talked about everything that happened and about our mom. My sister said it gets better once you move out. I think I might actually remember that moment for the rest of my life. 

I still feel like I'm depressed, but I think I'm getting better now that I've gotten this all off of my chest. ",2.0

a few friends have been ghosting me and blowing me off when we've set up plans to call and game

i have crippling anxiety talking to new people and trying to get closer to them. ive matched with a few people as friends on bumble but im mortified to talk to them

im only 20 but i feel like im never gonna find a love as intense as things were with him. we were really serious, gonna move in together and talked about marrying. then he just. threw me out. and is talking about me as if im some crazy ex girlfriend, when he was the one treating me terribly towards the end.

i feel like my friend group is shsttered. im scared to reach out to mutual friends out of fear that they hate me bc of what hes telling people. im scared i cant make friends anymore because of that and my extreme anxiety.

"I think the quote ""I dont want to live like this, but I dont want to die"" by Ezra Koenig, is the quote of the decade.I feel so trapped that I want to explode. I hate myself so much. At the same time I want to get better. I want to be better. For myself, and my parents. So these 20 something years werent just for nothing. So whoever is left behind cant retell history as ""sad, broken, disappointment, etc"". 

Ive hurt myself so much to the point that the thought of the temporary pain of suicide hardly phases me anymore. Been there, attempted that. I know all itll take this time is ~half a bottle of liquor and a couple of smokes at this point. 

On the other hand, im so fucking tired of hurting myself. I hardly have anywhere left thats concealed to hurt either way. I hardly feel it the same way. The only next extreme is just ending myself.  Im so tired of complaining and my excuses and spending what little money I have left on healing my wounds. Poor baby, wah wah waaah. So fucking stupid. But everytime I take this in and try go with that momentum of ""get the fuck up and change something"", I end up crashing even harder when I realize Im basically good for nothing. I have a lot of love and work ethic and curiosity to invest, I just dont know where the fuck to put it and its driving me insane. 

As much as I want to hang in there, all this time going by...all my hair falling out, health deteriorating, and looks fading....I dont have much grip left. As much as I try to figure shit out day by day, try to stay positive, etc, all of this time is just my being taking up space and wasting resources and mooching off of my parents who God bless them havent kicked my failure ass out onto the street.

As wonderful and exciting as all of this uncertainty can be, and once was, lately its just become overwhelming, daunting and terrifying.

"tw rape. life is shittycopy and paste from post before as I feel that I probably posted in the wrong subreddit before

throw away account. cant remember my old throwaway so oops
excuse the grammar ahead of time

2019 was been a shit show

- got raped multiple times by a cousin 

- cousin still in contact with me

- told my parents about the rape as a singular event and they responded extremely poorly (my fault, whore, cousin fucker, I wanted it, I deserve it) and still have him around me

- caught my mom cheating on my dad (hence the divorce)

- almost failed out of nursing school but didnt but lost my scholarship due to my gpa hitting the floor for a C

- new years was shitty 

- parents getting a divorce and throwing me in the middle of it and they're so on again off again

- grandma moved in with parents and constantly calling me having breakdowns over it. granted I'd have breakdowns too if I lived with my parents right now too

- lost a few friends due to me not reporting the rape granted I can see how they feel helpless so I've moved to trying not to talk to people about this stuff and rely on my counselors for that

- gained 20 pounds 

- mom encouraging ED behaviors since weight gain

- mom telling me she wishes she never had me

- had a friend commit suicide 

- shitty roommate situation which thankfully I manage to avoid the conflict but the tension is exhausting 

and now I'm just fed up. 
I've relapsed completely with my bulimia and cutting. flashbacks are out the wazoo and I feel like 75% of my day is me panicking unless I'm binging, purging or cutting. and at this point I'm so exhausted from trying to fight coping like this and feeling like shit on top of shit every day. I'm just so overwhelmed and I feel like nothing is going to ever get better. and if continuoully getting abused is what is in my future then I dont care. I feel so disgusting. even now I feel like I can't breathe properly because i feel like hes here

and I'm trying not to give up solely on the basis of my counselors being super supportive and motivating me but jesus this is so hard

I feel so broken and like damaged goods and like I'll never feel whole again
I dont even recognize myself spiritually, mentally or physically even more

I feel like every part of me has been destroyed and I'm just tired

"I think my mental health is too much for people and suicide seems like the only option.An old friend 'broke up' with me last week claiming that the panic attack I had a year ago was too much for her.

All of my friends talk about mental health all the time, but my anxiety is brushed off as me overthinking stuff.

I don't want to leave them. I feel like I would've failed and I would be alone.

I'm thinking of ending it. I feel trapped. If I run away and block them all, I'll be causing drama. If I talk about my mental health I'm causing drama and they prefer my old friend anyways. So I stay quiet and pretend it's all okay.

I'm in therapy and I'm trying really hard but these thoughts overwhelm me and I feel like I can't live anymore.

My mom is one of the most amazing loving persons you'd be lucky to meet. The fact that my life is so great makes me hate myself even more. I feel like a piece of shit, worthless. I'd hate to cause more pain to my family, but Ive been ""living"" this life for the past 9 years. Since I quit highschool I isolated myself. Don't know why I quit, or why i isolated myself. I'm tired of just watching time pass by for these 9 years, but I can't have a stable job, or commit to anything, really.

"It feels good knowing I can end my life, nowI made a promise to myself that if I wasn’t happy by May of 2019, I would give myself permission to commit suicide. Well, I’m nowhere near happy. As a matter of fact, I think I have developed PTSD from the last couple of years.

Life holds us down and tortures us. Everything we have, we lose at some point. Every loving relationship we have eventually goes away, or devolves into hatred. Your own body degrades and your mind goes. And that’s if you’re lucky. Life is not a gift. It is a curse. And when we question why not kill ourselves instead, life replies, “Hah! You don’t know what it’s like to experience nothing! You’re too scared to do it!”

And I am scared of death. I’m scared of experiencing nothingness. Thought I think we may possibly have a soul, I don’t think these souls will experience anything once we die. It’ll all probably just scatter in different directions, never to form again.

But honestly? There are moments in life where I would gladly call the bluff of life, and kill myself. I don’t care about hurting those who care, because I know they’ll all go away one day. One day we’ll *all* just go away. And life says to deal with it, because the alternative is nothing. Well I think I’m ready to call life out on that. Because once I die, life will have nothing left to torture me with. It will be a sort of morbid victory over entropy and pain.",2.0

We've been together for almost two years and it has been a lot of downs and ups. Between physical fights and hurtful arguments, bumps and bruises, mental and psychological scarring, we managed to love each other And try to make the best of it.  
 
A month ago I started having panic/anxiety attacks because of all the things we've been through to the point of my mother coming to get me from her house. The moment she needed me the most I went home. The moment she needed me my mother told her that homosexuality is a sin which caused her to sink even deeper. (My family is Jamaican and deeply rooted in Christianity) 

My girlfriend suffers from PCOS, being hearing impaired (and her hearing is currently getting worse), scalp psoriasis and sebhorric dermatitis. She is the only androgynous, heavily tattooed, biracial (black and Filipino), hearing impaired lesbian in her family and her family ignores her and doesn't make her feel like she's there. On top of that she's an only child and her parents don't even really give much of a damn about her and I've seen it first hand. 

She feels so alone on a daily basis because everyone that has ever been in her life has done her wrong. People she's called best friends, cousins, girlfriends, have taken advantage of her and used her and dragged her name through the mud to the point of her isolation. The point of where she can't keep a steady job 

Her biggest fear is her being alone for the rest of her life. She feels like she doesn't have a place anywhere. She feels like this is the life she's destined to live and she's scared and she wants to end it all. I've had to monitor her when she takes pills because she's overdosed before. 

I slipped up by only thinking of myself and thinking that she didn't need me because of all the things we went through and how she made me feel. I didn't think she loved me that much. I ignored her crying for me before I left and the day I left. 

I feel like utter crap. We have been unemployed for months because of our mental states. We have bills that are so backed up that our car might get repossessed, we've just lost the car insurance and or phone bills are way behind. I'm swimming in medical bills and her entire life is on the line. 

I feel helpless and I've added on to her loneliness when all I wanted to do was be her all and to be her family. I've in turn made her feel like how everyone has made her feel.

would it make sense to kill myself over this? I don't want to be stuck on this girl for 10 years. I don't want to waste my 20s on this girl. (22 since March) And I feel like I'm going to end up doing just that. 

I don't want to be pining for a girl who doesn't even think about me for all of my youth. it hurts.",2.0

"There seems to be no coverage of this method.For a long while and for many reasons, whether they be not wanting to upset my parents religious ideals that I will end up in Hell, or the grief and guilt that it would put upon my friends and family. This was and often still is a method that I think about and have tried and yet whenever I look up if anyone else has thought of the same thing or has these same feelings I always find nothing. In order to make suicide look like an accident many turn to the ‘suicide by cop’ or stepping out in front of a vehicle. But in a society (at least where I live) where there is a lot of violence at street level there are people who are willing to kill you over a phone. It’s like some sort of painful euthanasia. So, whether I’ve got all my valuables on me, coming back from the gym with a bag full of sweaty clothes or on my way to the chicken shop with nothing but some coins, every time I’ve been accosted or attacked in some sort of attempted mugging or whatnot I’ve never handed anything over or backed down-To many on the outside this has seemed like some sort of bravado or ego related ordeal but in fact it was the best way I thought I could die without anyone thinking that I was going through anything. To this day (and thankfully, I guess) no one has fully gone through with it but I still think about this method at least once a day, and rather than steering clear of dangerous looking groups, locations and situations where there are people known to want to harm me I will travel through them on purpose- to the others a sign of bravery and boldness but to me I’m just really hoping someone else can take me out because I know I can’t.",2.0

We have two children so I gave up trying to save him to save my kids mental health. But in the process of all the madness I forgot about my own. Now I’m a widowed single mother with ptsd, severe depression and all I want to do is off myself. I’ve tried to keep myself going by going back to school. I have a new job. My own place.

"Without the threat of suicide, why should anyone care?I know in my heart of hearts that I won't kill myself. But goddamnit if it isn't appealing. I don't want to die, but I want to be dead. This seemingly invalidates everything I ever think. If I'm not going to kill myself, then who gives a shit? I've been fairly good about not self harming to a degree that will permanently scar or damage me but I don't know how long I can keep that up. Mental health only seems to matter to people when suicide becomes a threat or after a suicide has taken place. I've isolated myself, started self harming, and nobody fucking know. Not a single person in my family knows or even suspects anything. I'm in my room ""doing work"". The reality is that I spend my day feeling shitty and getting nothing done, going to bed at 12AM, waking up at between 2AM and 5AM and getting all my work done before school. This has been my mode of life for the past four weeks. And nobody knows. I'm that good at hiding this shit. So when is it going to matter? I've almost been able to trick myself that I'm doing fine. People ask how I'm doing and it's goddamn robotic at this point; ""good, you?"". So I'll just wait until suicidal ideation turns into suicidal tendencies huh? Maybe I'll figure out what I'd do if I do become suicidal. It seems strangely comforting to know that I would have a way out if it gets that bad.",2.0

"I fully don’t know what makes me want to kill myself more: school or home?I’m still in high school, and these have been the worst years of my life. At school I have no friends, and there’s just a very strong mean girl/bully culture that I can’t stand (it’s an all girls). Obviously I’ve tried making friends, but none of the friendships have been that genuine.

At home I feel like I have no one to talk to and I can’t truly express myself because my family is very judgemental, they don’t trust me, and they’re just not accepting of a lot of things. I also have no one to talk to — because every time I tell them about my real emotions they just invalidate them, and say I’m over exaggerating. I’m also the only girl and I’m the youngest, and I strongly feel that they don’t respect me and look down on me because of that. The arguments always “well you’re only sixteen, you’re being dramatic” or “I’m sure it’s not that bad” or “you’re the reason you’re sad”

I have so many emotions, but no one to talk to them about and it makes me feel so lonely. A lot of the time I feel like: maybe I am being over dramatic, like I’m just too sensitive and I should just get over myself. But it’s getting so hard to see the silver lining in situations when both my home and my school life make me sad. I always can’t help but think — what if I end it all? A lot of the times it feels like no one would care anyways, and it would be better because I’m just a burden. It would be easier for everyone else to not have to think about me anymore.",2.0

"Just feel so aloneBroke up with my GF of 5 years yesterday. While that is difficult in and of itself (as i still love her but she had fallen out of love with me - don't blame her at all) the real struggle is that i moved from UK to New Zealand to be with here. Have been here a year and a half now and haven't made a single friend. 

While we were together i could kind of put that out of my mind. We lived together so she was always there and as my social life died i leant more on her.

This is really difficult as i was someone who always had tons of friends around me growing up. While i did go through a pretty sever bout of depression in my teens (including self harm and a suicide attempt) it is something I haven't really lived with since then.

However over the last 6 months, as my relationship deteriorated, that old whisper started to re-emerge. Would just be getting on with my day and it would come out of Nowhere ""Kill yourself""  would sometimes even shock me.

However increasingly it has moved from a one off whisper to a never ending shout and is all i can think about.

A old coping strategy i used to have was listing all the things i was thankful for/good things i had going in my life....however i can't name one at the moment.

I can't sleep (currently 4am and be awake for hours) and all i am thinking about is how do i go on. I can't face being alone every single day. I have literally no one - there are only 3 numbers stored in my phone 1 is my ex and the other 2 are work.

See people on here who are saying that their friends are getting tired of them and i am so jealous. To have someone to talk to - even about the most trivial of things would be a lifeline i can only dream of right now.

As i look forward to weekends spent entirely alone, birthday with no one to spend it with, Xmas with not a person around I really don't think i can take it any more.

The real kicker is - if i kill myself at home no one would even know until the rent didn't get paid.......that's how much i mean to people",2.0

"My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years, he's in college and he wants to work to have extra spending money, his friend who works at a restaurant said that he'd help him get a job there. The staff at this restaurant are at least 90% female and I'm not really okay with this, I don't know what to say to him about it so I haven't mentioned the thing about other girls, but I have expressed that I would rather he not get a job. My family is from Chile and my father had an investors Visa and that is how we got to the US, my parents are very well off and I have told my boyfriend that I'd be completely fine with financially supporting him at least even just while he's in school, and he said he still wants a job ""for the social aspect as well"".

"Why is life so hardI'm not entirely sure if this is or isn't the right place to post looking at some of the others, maybe my curiosity isn't intense enough to be on this page but here goes.   


 I keep circling back to the thought of an easy way out IE just ending it all to put myself at rest, to stop feeling so alone and unwanted - a life without purpose or friends, and not for lack of trying either. My mental issues seem to keep people away from me, including any potential partners or lovers, and just friends in general. But most of all I just feel a void inside myself where I feel nothing but sadness, not sadness as in crying but just a sense of me missing something but I don't know what it is. I have worked so many jobs in my life so far, and I'm not even old, I've tried so many hobbies and even been on drugs/ alcohol which is/was only a short term solution to numbing myself and being able to some semblance of happiness in the moment by myself just watching some YouTube or something. I sometimes get invited out by work colleagues but I end up just sitting there realising I have nothing in common with these socialites, and I realise this is such a common occurrence nearly everywhere I go. I've even had counselling twice but nothing came of it, antidepressants once but that didn't make a dent. Sometimes I just feel life is too hard to live, and there is always one issue after another, and stresses every damn day. I have yet to have anything solid that seems to give me purpose or happiness in life.   


 If any of you out there have ever felt the same and somehow overcome it, I would love some advice. I'm not thinking of ending it all now, but I keep coming back to it and I want to find a way to just be happy and content with the misery that is my life. Thank you for reading.",2.0

"Suicidal urges during upcoming holidaysI don't know if I should have put this in r/suicidewatch or another sub. But I have been feeling more suicidal or considering suicide over the past week.

I read about how mixing pills like Tylenol and alcohol, drinking cough syrup, etc might get the job done.

I think the recent stress of being laid off, not being able to work because we're moving in month, not being able to tell my parents what is going on with me. It just seems easier to leave or take my life. I don't think I will live to see my 25th birthday. It seems stupid to have such a reaction to a family get together, but every time I've had to spend time with family, the feeling becomes worse. I think this is the year that I may take my life.

I have my 45 though. Clean, cold, loaded.

"After Years of depression, now thisHello

I'm a foreign student in Germany. I've never been a good student, although I love learning things. You must finish Bachelor by the 9th semester here and I've gotten to the 12th with extension, which I did 3 times. This is my last semester, whether I finish it with a degree or get kicked out.

I've been writing my thesis, started in November 2015. There were these couple of months, where I couldn't write anything, so I talked to my supervisor and he told me I had until 13.06.- time to finish it. It's almost finished and ready but today he talked to the secretary of the professor and she says I was supposed to submit it in March. I should've checked the correct deadline, I didn't. It's not my supervisor's fault.

I've been in depression for several years now. A couple of months ago everything was great and after talking to my doctor I've stopped taking anti-depressants. I've had days, when I've regretted waking up, wishing I'd stayed asleep. This is something worse.

My family isn't rich, so I also feel tremendous guilt about the money my father sends me. I was supposed to finish Bachelor in 3 and Master in 2 years, it's been 6 years of throwing hard earned money down the drain for me, and I still haven't even earned a bachelor degree.

The last couple of weeks I've felt good, maybe first time in years. Things were going good, I was very motivated to write my thesis. Now I don't even know how I feel. Feels like falling down a cliff so fast, I don't know when I'll land. I don't know if I'll be alive to land.

My supervisor said, that extensions for the deadline is possible. I'm probably not qualified for those. Even if I was, I had to apply for an extension before the March deadline.

I've felt suicidal before and I just kept going, hoping it'll be better tomorrow. I'm not sure it'll be better tomorrow.

What can I do?

EDIT: It's been cleared. I've spoken with the secretary and after speaking with the other secretary of the main committee, she fixed the date. There wasn't a formal extension but a memo of some kind, of which I've no knowledge. 
It was very scary, and to think I'm still this close to madness, scares me. Thank you to everyone who took time to write to me. ",2.0

"""An interesting title"", I think not.Hi 

Tonight I guess is the night I actually try.
There's not much history to me - perfectly normal childhood, no significant disabilities, depressive episodes every so often.

I've OD'd 3 times. The first one landed me in an inpatient psychiatric unit for 4 months.
I don't know if it was a cry for help - I just ended up getting help because someone called me selfish and I felt guilty.

This time is going to be different. 
I care. I think I care. About the people I'm (hopefully) leaving behind - But at the end of the day, this is my life. Not anyone else's. I am so unhappy all the time. The only thing I can think about is dying and I just wish that people would forget about me so I won't hurt anyone.

My friend from the unit died 3.5 weeks ago. It was kind of my fault. 
I guess i'm the next domino in the suicide chain.

I'm on here because I want to get it off my chest, but I can't tell a ""real"" person because they'd try and stop me and that would just make everyone think that i'm not serious and all of this is for attention.

I don't want to die. I really don't. But I have to.
Things are never going to get better because at the end of the day, there's nothing to get better from.

"suicidal girlfriend.guys, i need some help. im worried about my girlfriend, shes not suicidal now. but before she met me she was. she nearly killed herself multiple times before she met me, its been 1 year and 2 months since i met her, im kinda scared that if she gets depressed she'll get those thoughts again, she told me that because of me, she has never been happier. i saved her. but im still scared, im scared that if i disappoint her she might get upset and have thoughts about killing herself, she means the world to me, and i mean the world to her. i need some help on how to make her forget those thoughts, i try my hardest to stop those thoughts, ive bought her many things to make her happy, ive focused more of my time on her more than anything else. i try to have dates with her as much as possible. etc... i even kissed every single one of the cuts she had on her wrist (41 cuts),ive shown her my family and they all love her. please give me some suggestions. if i posted this on the wrong place im sorry, its just, she used to be suicidal and im not sure if she still is and if she is im trying to make her forget all those thoughts. thank you, ill appreciate any type of answer really, anything is good enough.

"How will I ever cope with my sisters suicide???My sister is/was my best friend, my partner in crime and best big sister I could ever have hoped for.

She killed herself in September, and I cannot cope.

I cry everyday (im crying now just typing) I miss her so much.
I hate to think how alone she felt and I know I could have helped her. 

I hate thinking that she thought she had no other option, that the best thing to do was end it all...

Hundreds of people were at her funeral. She was the funniest, most caring, generous person. And it just isnt right that she is gone.

How do you cope?
How do you ""move on""??

My parents and my other sisters just dont know how to help me. and neither do I.

My body actually aches with the amount i miss her.

We've both had suicidal moments in our lives, both suffered terribly with depression and we said that if either of us did it how pissed off we would be. We made a pact never to abandon each other. 

And Im left in a dark world without her. 

Any advice would be so appreciated.

p.s. anyone considering suicide, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE dont fucking do it. You have so many options and avenues to take and you have no idea the pain and suffering the people that love you will have to endure for a lifetime, and you wont be there to help them through.

"MTHFRDeplin has started to wear off.  No more magic bullet for my broken krebs cycle.  Norepinephrine (""fight or flight neurotransmitter"") has far too much influence over how I present myself to others.  And I'm getting tunnel vision of the worst sort.

About to go to a job fair tomorrow.  The collective voice of everyone in the room will agree on one thing:

*No matter your grades, no matter your credentials, no matter who you know or what you know or what you have to offer, your genetics are ultimately what make you noncompetitive.  MTHFR has made you depressed and unrelatable, while everyone else in this room is chipper, energetic, and outgoing.  A guy with a head full of norepinephrine is a liability to our image and is very bad for our bottom line.  Just stay away from us.*

I'm not considering suicide in the sense of physical death, just the solitary outcome of being alive with shit genetics:  ""reputational death.""

"Blood thinners, booze, and a razor.A culmination of teen angst, melodrama and depression has lead me to my bed, crying for the first time in years, while listening to Brand New, because *gosh* I'm so deep and different. 

This is your run of the mill ""i got broken up with im sad"" post. My SO called my buddy today to tell him she's still in love with her long past ex, and how they've still been fucking around. Being used and lied to isn't what hurts. Her specifically cheating isn't what hurts. It's that this is the fifth (**5th**) relationship I've been cheated on in.

The first one stung, that was the very first person I was ever with. That one pushed me down dope road, which I've since gotten off of unfortunately. Second one hurt, but not as much. By the third one, it started to get comical, raising questions such as ""haha fuck what's wrong with me"". When the fourth happened I was entirely numb, but this fifth has really instilled a new sense of absolute hopelessness.

Of course that's not the only issue. A childhood filled with mental abuse and crippling mental illness have obviously made their contributions. Wanting to commit suicide since twelve, and three failed attempts at that. The complete lack of close friends I could speak to about my problems, not that it would help because I'd never be able to vocalize them, find the right words to explain what is going on in my head. No motivation to seek a professional.

Either way, I'm not here to spill my whole life story. I, like most, just wanted a soapbox to stand on, and groan a few vain last words. Leave a mark, as small as it may be. And if I have any regrets, it's that I hadn't left a large enough mark. Nothing of value created, no book written, no painting finished, no drawings built. Of all the things I've wanted to do in life, there's nothing to show for any of them. But, accomplishments don't exactly mean much dead.

My ex and I have been living together for about a year out of financial necessity. She and the kids will be moving in with her mother for a little while in January.  I will be out of funds. I have no car. I know many will say I am selfish, but it's for the best. Both my kids are young. They will forget about me soon enough. My ex will surely get together with her boyfriend soon.

I haven't figured out yet how to exit this world. I must think of a way that will have the least amount of impact. Mainly, so my kids know as little as possible about my death. But also, because my life had little impact.

However, the guilt and sadness over possibly hurting my daughters is crushing my heart.

"im so brokenim a girl in high school. that should really start things off well. i used to be so happy

things got really bad when my brother started getting suicidal thoughts. now looking back, i think he used it to get out of trouble. i ended up doing his chores and taking a lot of blame for him because i thought he needed it. 

now he hears me screaming and crying and he NEVER ONCE simply asked if i was ok. never. neither my sister. my parents bought my brother a therapist. i’ve asked FOUR FUCKING TIMES FOR ONE and my mom always said. yes i’ll look into it. HOW HARD CAN IT FUCKING BE???? ITS BEEN 5 MONTHS MOM. you’ll regret it when i’m not alive next week. 

the first time i opened up ab how i was feeling, my sister told my mom i was lying for attention, so my mom scheduled a fake appointment to the neurologist to have me confess. i never did because it was true. 

i went to my pediatrician and she gave me adderall for weight loss and minor depression. now, i have a fucking eating disorder and major depression. if i miss a dose i’ll sleep for 18 hours straight and become suicidal to the point i have to go to bed AGAIN so i won’t KILL MYSLEF

on top of that, my two best friends have been also dealing with depression, both in and out of hospitals. once they were both gone at the same time, which i think made everything worse for me. 

i have a hard time talking ab how i feel because for my entire life i’ve been told i’m overdramatic. 

im most upset ab my parents. they know i’m like this. i’ve called them to my room crying because of a gushing nose bleed that went all over my bed from crying too much. still no fucking help

so i’m done. i’m done fucking living. i’m done breathing. o hate feeling sad all the time feeling hopeless. when i’m on adderall i’m a whole different person which makes me feel even worse. i’m done",2.0

"I will do it this time.I'm not depressed (I went through diagnostics and I'm not) or anything, but I want to kill myself. I've been planning to do it for about a year, without much success, but I'm completely determined this time.

It's hard to explain why exactly I want to do this. I just never felt like life is worth all the effort. It's just mediocre for the vast majority of it. School sucked, university (at least the two months before I stopped attending) sucked even worse. Now I'm stuck on campus without money, place to live (they'll kick me out of campus at the end of December and my parents don't want me to come back).

So, following my parents' advice I should get a job. But there's a problem with that. Call me lazy as much as you want, but I don't want to do it. I see absolutely no logic behind working. My life is shit as it is, but now I have to make even more efforts to live it. Here comes the idea of suicide.

I don’t have any skills and I doubt that I will ever get a real job. I haven’t been truly happy in years and I always end up miserable. No one has taken me seriously, so I think it’s impossible to get help at this point. I feel like living is torture and I don’t think life is worth living if I don’t enjoy being alive.

I'm just so fucking angry and disappointed and miserable and exhausted **all the time.** It never stops because I keep screwing more stuff up when I try. I don't succeed at anything, anymore. It's like someone keeps hitting the refresh button on all the negativity in my life because I can't fucking get away from it.

And I'm just so full of hate. I hate everything, I hate being alive. I hate it like I never thought I *could* hate anything. I hate myself more than any other awful thing in the world because there's no removing me from my thoughts.

and please don`t tell me that it ""isn't all that bad"" or ""things will get better"" because i have accepted this fact that life is nothing but pain and suffering since i was around 11 or 12 and still think this is the most realistic view after 13 years.


the only problem is my friends and family that i don't want to put through the suffering. yet i dont want to continue living without purpuse, motivations or joy (except making otghers happy, i do enjoy that but it is not enough.)


so here's my question: what is the best method in witch i could take my life with as minimal emotional damage for others? what should i say in advance for example? and how can i make sure that it doesn't look like i had alot of pain upon death?

"I Hate Leaning on PeopleI like to think I love people. They interest me in many ways, including myself since I'm one of them. However, it really drains me the idea that I'm leaning on others too much. There's no other way to put it. I have no idea how far I should be at this point in life or how independent, except that most people my age are married and/or working. 

Recently, this leaning on others thing has become more of an issue, because as I get older everyone seems to expect more independence of me, and I get insecure and 'hide' in my room instead of being there and talking, because I'm worried they'll make some snarky but sincere comment that I'm not working hard enough or that I'm a freeloader (I loathe that word). It really does make me feel suicidal at times. Like I would rather be anywhere but there. The shame... 

So what can I do to feel less guilty for leaning on other people? Maybe I should buy my family a gift like champagne or something. ",2.0

as if I have a sense of self;
I've been used up, and instead of in the trash, put back on the shelf

Why does anybody do anything?
Why are we here?
Just to suffer, I must admit there's nothing I hold dear 

We all die but who really lives;
I know it's not me;

They nod and agree;
Their closed minds have closed my eyes to what this world could be 

I cling to anyone who sees;
The nature of their lies;
But to live in spite is even worse, I'd still rather die

Oh god;
You know I dont think you're real;
Still there must be someone to blame for the way I've been made to feel 

I guess soon I'll know;
What has been debated for years;
God or not, this life is already a hell crafted by my fears

Eighteen now;

"i think i really would be better off deadmy only friend is my girlfriend. i love my girlfriend so so much. and i feel the love back. but i feel like sometimes i burden her. she was telling me how all of my other friends were toxic, and eventually they all ended up leaving me. so many people have left me because they think me being sad is annoying. and i really do try not to be sad when with people. i try to hide it but sometimes it slips though and they would tell me to go home. and i feel awful because when i want to vent about it she says it makes her upset and then we derail talk about her problems. and i know she isn’t purposely trying to make it about herself but then i have no one to talk about mine to. i know i must be like severely mentally ill, i’ve been diagnosed with severe depression and add but something else must be up because whenever my girlfriend is upset with me that’s all i can think about, even if i feel like it’s a stupid reason i have to keep reassuring myself it’s okay. because most times when she’s mad she will keep leaving me on read and then text me the next day like nothing happened. i feel like she just gets annoyed with me sometimes. and i’ve been conflicted for awhile if i should end it all because i don’t want her to be alone. but i think she’d feel better if i was gone. because i love her so much and i want her to be happy. and as for my family, they are almost always mad at me because of what i want my career to be, etc. i think if i killed my self everyone would be at peace. suicide is always in the back of my mind. i don’t think that’s normal. i want help. but my family thinks i’m lying. my girlfriend encourages me to get help but i don’t want to trouble her. i’ve been crying for hours. i’m thinking of mixing pills and alcohol once my mom leaves for work. i don’t know yet though, i want to see my girlfriend again but this quarantine shit is going on. of course i would never tell her i’m feeling suicidal because i don’t want her to be mad. she knows ive been suicidal before but she thinks she helped fix it and i don’t want to disappoint her. but i’m just so depressed. i don’t know what to do",2.0

"should I just end it this summer? And if so, how?I had suicidal thoughts since I was 8, and tried killing myself when I was 9 fro the first time. For more than a 1/3 of my life I always felt depressed. I always felt like I was a burden on others, to be honest the only reason I'm still here is because of the internet. I have attempted drinking bleach, ingesting random pills, hanging myself, chocking, and cutting. None has worked so far. A couple of weeks ago my school found out about my cut marks, it is forbiden in my religion to commit suicide, but I just can't stop myself. I am hoping to end it this summer at around 5-7am. So that there would be nobody to stop me. I am yet to decide which way to kill myself. But I'm hoping for something that doesn't hurt too much, for example no stabbing myself. I'm also quite not sure whether I should just run away from home, and do it in a remote area. Or just in my home. What's the most perfect plot in your point of view?",2.0

People have been urging me to take therapy before I kill myself but I won't because I'm pretty sure it's b*******For the last 10 years people have been telling me that I should get therapy before I do something terrible to myself. But I've met someone who took therapy. She constantly reminds herself how beautiful she is and how she has worth. But the truth is she looks like a fucking morbidly obese frog. She sits in her room all day and only briefly comes out to make everyone else miserable. She's cruel to animals and people alike. Everyone still avoids her at all cost. One day someone will find her lonely decomposing body sitting in front of her computer. Now she's so self-important that she post dozens of Facebook pictures of her in front of a river meditating.

"If I leave a message that I am planning to kill myself on the 6th, will the therapist call back this time?Would like to set up appointment with a therapist I have not called yet. The one I have called, did call back, but I kept missing it the call and apparently they will not answer the phone. You must answer them. It is hard for me to answer the phone, but now I can. Yet he won't call back. So I figure, try the only other one that my insurance covers. But I am used to this. My insurance is through the state (Medicaid I believe) so I am treated like the dirt that I am. No one wants to help a scumbag like me, why should they when they know I am getting welfare? I deserve this.

What will happen if one the second or third message I leave a message saying that I have plans to kill myself on the 6th?

I'm being self-destructive, pushing away anyone I can, even somewhat going out of my way to cause new problems at work.  I keep drifting back and forth between feeling like it's pointless and like it's just torture.  Why does it hurt to exist if there's no point to existing?  

I can't explain how I feel to anyone.  When I try, they stop me, tell me to go see a therapist.  Therapists are not my favorite people, the last few all being somewhat an addition to my problems rather than a help.  One liked to answer her cell phone in the middle of sessions.  Another would shorten our sessions for various reasons.  The first therapist I ever met would draw circles over and over the entire time I talked.  The first few times she took notes.  I guess she gave up on helping at some point after then.

I've been hospitalized.  That didn't help.  The drugs they've been shoving down my throat for the last five years aren't helping.  I'm hurting.  I feel bad all the time.  I'm sleeping but it's not good sleep.

"Suicidal thought buildupI get regularly depressed; it's been that way for a really long time. And until this past few months I've managed to keep it under control. I pushed myself out of bed, showered, went to class, swam as a workout, etc. I graduated last summer and moved in with my girlfriend (she's wonderful).

But, as of now I have had a lot of job submissions and interviews but have landed nothing. As everyone is aware, living is expensive, and I've seen my bank account just chip away as I look around for employment. I can barely afford the basics for my girlfriend and myself. And those old thoughts, those deep dark *sad* thoughts, have caught up with me. Those thoughts that *you're worthless* or *you can't do anything right*, creep up on me even when I'm doing fine.

Simple critiques of me just have devastating effects: I lose my sense of hunger, I don't sleep; thinking of what I did wrong, my everyday motivation and creativity just evaporate. Then those feelings make me less social and more irritable and then I realize I'm not treating people as well as I should be... The cycle continues in this negative feedback loop.

And it's just accumulating to a point where I find myself thinking about killing myself on a regular basis. I know that ending my life will be a living nightmare for those that I love and care about. It will follow my parents, my brother, my girlfriend and her family, and my friends until they die.

But I just *can't* keep going on like this. I'm probably not giving my wonderful girlfriend the love she deserves. Right now all I feel is that deep gut hurt, the empty feeling that just sucks color away from life. I just need help. Maybe a little space and a soft cry will help. I honestly didn't think I would be showing my thoughts anywhere, especially on the internet. To whomever is reading this, thank you. I hope you are OK.

"I want to cease to existHello, everyone. I don’t even know why I’m writing this, I guess I’m just trying to understand what is happening. About 7 years ago I slowly started on my spiritual journey. I appeared always as a very happy, smiley, bubbly person, but deep inside I was scared and judgmental and hurt. I am an only child and my parents thought what makes you stronger in life is violence. My mom would lose it if I would get a -A in Elementary School and would beat me. Long story short, after all this work of discovering myself and trying to be a better person, I completely lost my purpose or interest in life. I am not numb anymore, but I am nervous all the time, I feel extremely stressed al the time. My body is always in fight or flight mode. Today, I feel I don’t even want an afterlife.

Normal people can go to school easily, without losing any stuff, they can think naturally and say everything they want, they don't make any mistakes, I always make mistake that ashame me in public. 

I'm a failure, I never think, eat, naturally, always in my own world, I feel like that I have issues who other people haven't, I feel like a burden for my ""friends"" (I don't know if they consider me as a real friend, considering many friends in the past had backstabbed me)  I don't think I deserve to live anymore on this planet, I don't think there is any solution for me, It's just the way I am. I've began to theorize that I'm mentally disabled like my brother since November 2015, I've theorized that I've asperger's syndrome. (My brother have Pervasive developmental disorder, and some Uncles and Aunts on my father's side has issues too) But, after the summer's vacations had begun, I could again go seek refuge in my own world. But now since hell had begun, I've theorized that I have ADHD, because it matches with what I did in the past. 

People around me don't think I'm mentally disabled, but when I begin to stress or something like that when I'm alone or with my parents, I begin to bite myself or scream, I know that my parents are fed up with this, so I will no longer make suffer them, I don't want to live anymore with this life. Why normal people should live an easier life than me ? or why should I live an harder life than normal people ? It's not fair, I don't think I will survive this. These days and some months before, I see myself hanged on a rope, or I see my former school when I was bullied burning to the ground. Because It's this, if I want to live, I have to burn it, so I could be free and unleash my anger to those who bullied me. Or I decide to end my suffering, and people will be no longer annoyed by me.

"there’s no way outliving is hard, dying (and not being part of the percentage that ends up disabled, humiliated, etc) is almost harder. and i thought i was getting better. i thought i wouldn’t have a night like this again. i have a boyfriend who loves me, i have (some) family that would be devastated. and all i can think about sometimes is how much i miss the person i used to be.

 what do i do? i feel claustrophobic in my own body. i keep getting pieces of hope but it’s just delaying the inevitable—maybe it would be better if i just hit rock bottom so i could just pull the cord, finally. no fucks given.

this will never be fucking worth it, will it? i’ll always end up back here, won’t i",2.0

I’m so ducking lonelyThe only person I can really trust moved away recently and I’m noticing that I’m isolating myself from my friends. I don’t want to do this but I can’t stop. I’m starting to log out of social media just so I can stop seeing that in left on read and see my friends at parties I was invited to but turned down out of shear anxiety and terror that I’ll fuck my life up even worse meeting someone who ghosts me. I’m so scared and tired. I want to change but my body doesn’t let me. I can’t sleep. I can’t think. I don’t even know if I’m consciously thinking anymore or if I’m just going through the motions of everyday life. Anytime I make an effort to make plans with anyone they always find an excuse. I’ve never wanted to be with someone as much as I want to stay far away from everyone. I’m breaking. I don’t know if I can keep going on like this. Can someone please fucking help me out of this. I’m at my last resort. ,2.0

"Don't know how I'll live if girlfriend commits suicideI don't really know how we are going to get through this. My girlfriend has given up on life, she is very depressed and is giving up on all her dreams. She is a uni student who might have to retake final year for a course she hates and with pressure to do well from her parents (more herself pressuring herself). She's doing this course to be able to get a job and stay in the country as she is an international student. But she hates having to do things she hates to do the thing she actually wants to do, and sees no future without pain. She has OCD depression and anxiety so is rarely in completely good mood.

She says she has set a date for killing herself and will finish off things in her life before she dies. I'm trying to help her but I feel like I can't do that right.

I'm terrified. I (20M) also have bad mental health, and I self harmed through teen years with multiple suicide attempts. I have no dreams, no skills, no enjoyment in life. We've been dating for a year and a half, and I feel we are perfect for each other. I dream of growing old with her. For once I have a reason I want to live rather than just a reason I need to live (don't want mum to be alone in life). 

I don't know how I'll live without her, or live with guilt of failing to save her. She's the only thing in life I enjoy. I'm so scared of losing her. I'm already a mess and she hasn't even left yet. I want to just end if before she does so I don't have to have more pain. It's my fault if she dies, I'm clearly a worthless boyfriend if I can't help her enjoy life.

I don't know what to do, I'm tired of this life of all happiness getting taken away. I don't know what to do anymore, what's the point in trying for anything all it leads to is more pain. Everything hurts. I don't even know why I bothered posting this, we are probably just both doomed.",2.0

"A friend's girlfriend talked about killing herself.First i want to excuse if this wasn't the appropriate place for this. A friend girlfriend just said she thinks about killing herself. But before that, here comes some context. My friend is dating this girl for about one year, lets call her Michelle. She is a very nice person but since the begining she was slightly different. She would frequently start a conversation and then suddenly meshing a lot of subjects that in the end doesn't make sense at all. I would find her behaviour funny. And oftenly joked about it with my girlfriend. It happens that this weekend i made a a dinner and invited my people to come and this friend too. It all happened good until today, when i was talking to my girfriend and she told me that Michelle talked some nonsense things as usual and one specific word made me feel shocked, it was suicide. She said that she thought it was just a silly thing but i was just freezed. Instantly after i took knowledge about the issue i just felt horrible. I could just see what i always read here, that is, people who is near the person but is unable to detect the signs or ends up making jokes without realizing the ""stranger behaviour"" could be a mask to something deeper. I instantly educated my girlfriend about it and that anyone that says something like that must be taken very serioulsy. I just imagined the scene of somebody calling and saing she killed herself and everybody just saying "" ohh i never thought she would really do it"". Now i am aware of the problem and will never underestimate it. I feel like i should talk to my friend about it but i don't know how he might feel because i know it is something very private. But i know i had to talk to him the sooner i can. I know she already made therapy but didn't liked it, do anyone has any suggestions on how to deal with this ? Or any similar experience with someone closer that talked about suicide ? Thanks everyone for the attention.",2.0

I’m 15 now and i have a dependency on weed, i’m a borderline alcoholic, I use cocaine almost every weekend, I have unbearable hppd from abusing psychedelics and i can’t go more than a couple days without popping a couple benzos. I’m failing all my classes and my parents are completely oblivious to my habits. All my counselors say i’m not going to graduate high school and i should try something alternative but my parents just won’t have it.  They keep on pushing me and i can’t fucking take it anymore. The only thing i have to keep me going is a school trip to Japan i’m going on over spring break next week. After that i don’t know what i’m going to do. I’m losing all hope and the only things that bring me joy are my asshole friends, drugs and binge watching the office.

Due to my event, I now suffer from ptsd, depression, anxiety, paranoia, night terrors and get an average of about 0-3 hours of sleep a night for about 4 years now. I hear his voice. I see him sometimes. The paranoia and distrust caused me to end my marriage. That divorce left me with $18 to my name and I moved out with some friends in another state. I opened up to one woman, who was one of two roommates, who had been through something similar and we loved one another then I ended up pushing her away too and she’s since left me and is sleeping with our other roommate. Each night is horrific hearing them. My job while easy in itself is stressing me because of how poorly the other employees do. I can’t handle it all. I’ve since far surpassed my threshold and now I just want to end it all. I have no will or motivation if life whatsoever. I’m a robot on autopilot. Wake up (or simply get up if I don’t sleep), go to work, go home and lay down. Waiting for it all to end sometime.

"Practicing for the endSo I've been practicing hanging myself on a daily basis when my girlfriend isn't home. I've also been constricting rope around my neck to see what it feels like to drift out of conciousness.

For the last year I've been vividly reliving all my worst moments and reacting to those memories with painful emotions. I remember when my father was in a coma and I didn't visit him because I thought he wasn't going to make it. I just couldn't take seeing him like that. He pulled through but I feel awful every day. I remember when I broke up with a girlfriend when I was 16 because she was acting pretty crazy, but her mother was dying. That's just fucking awful.

My life has just been a series of events where I've had the opportunity to be brave but have instead reacted with cowardice.

I realise the irony of contuing the trend of being a coward with existing by taking the ""easy way out"".

I'm worried I've become too involved in living and that it would definitely hurt many people when I'm gone. I also think it would be for the better.

I struggle with the worst intrusive thoughts and I feel like a terrible human being. I haven't seen my sisters in years and I feel I'm drifiting further from reality everyday. Before lockdown at least I felt human by going to work and pretending to be something. Now I feel like nothing.

There are awful things that happened to my older sister. My family never told me. I found out recently from a family friend. She was drugged and raped by a group of men from my hometown.

Since then I've been revisiting the memories of the past and trying to see them with this new knowledge and it makes things make a lot of sense.

I was always afraid to go to a psychiatrist because I assumed that her change in behaviour was due to the medication she was given. Now it makes sense that she became seemigly hollow and numb as a result of the bad things that happened to her and not the medication.

This gives me hope that perhaps medication can save me. I'm just finding it very hard to make that step. I'm uncertain that I can be fixed.",2.0

 Can't really think of a reason to get out of bed today. I think this might be what a downward spiral is all about. Anyway, hope some of you can relate, see you in another life.

&amp;#x200B;

The want to want.

&amp;#x200B;

 I have never been a driven guy. I have always been one who steers clear from change, lingering in the status quo. I chose what university to go to with little to no research, I chose a major simply because I had to, I am who I am, where I am, because of uninformed decisions made through my own laziness and the constant harassment of friends and family urging, coaxing, begging me to try to be a positive member of society. 

&amp;#x200B;

The issue is I don’t want that. I have little work ethic and have found no passions in life beyond napping and drinking. With the GPA I have earned through over indulging my finite pastimes the future ahead of me looks bleak and grim. I’ll get a mid range paying job at a reputable firm with a long and corporate sounding title that’ll do little but stroke my ego because in reality I’ll spend the next 30 years giving away my time, passion, and sanity to a concrete building and a fat man behind a desk. I see people grasping at even the smallest opportunities with both hands but I can barely rouse myself to watch them as they pass me by. 

&amp;#x200B;

My father is a self made millionaire, born in a small European town, both my sisters were lucky enough to go to a great high school where they both passed with mostly all A\*s (I remember my sister crying because she only got an A on something in school, she thought she’d never go to university.) Me? I pat myself on the back when I go to all my classes in a week, or when I didn’t do as bad on the test I didn’t study for as I thought I had.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m constantly surrounded by people who’s average is my extra mile, who are driven and emboldened by the things that they do, who have a set path in front of them and are doing everything in their power to push themselves forward. I have squandered countless chances, where others have spent their entire life climbing to, I have found myself simply drifting. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I’m not sure where to go from here. I am dissatisfied with mediocrity, yet have no passion to change it. I want to want the things that get people out of bed in the morning, but I don’t. Every second of every day feels like I am just waiting, waiting for something more, waiting for something to put butterflies in my stomach again, waiting for something to remind me that life shouldn’t be just waiting.",2.0

The problem is, part of my future plans involved working really hard at work, getting raised to the salary that I deserve (and the salary I know the company pays other employees in my position), and basically continually progressing towards being able to actually afford to have a family, to live in a place that has more than one fucking room, etc. 

The problem is after all of my hard work, I got a raise that barely covers my rent increase. I take home an extra $25 per paycheque. But I work harder than most anyone else. I pick up extra responsibilities, I pick up the slack of other people who are completely incompetent - yet somehow easily make at least $5k more than me every year. My manager basically confirmed that yes, I make less than most people, but no, I can't get a better raise, it's impossible. 

And now, I'm hopeless again. I had started to believe that there is hope, there is purpose in life, that if I try hard, it will actually MEAN something, but it fucking doesn't.

For the first time in 5 months last night...I thought SERIOUSLY about killing myself. The impulse to just get out of bed and do it was so strong. I'm scared that this is back. I don't know how to make it go away again, because I feel completely powerless and hopeless. Nothing I do fucking matters, why the FUCK do I work so hard to LIVE when everyone just FUCKS you for wanting to live? I make shit all. I work fucking hard, I quit another job to focus on this one, manager kept dangling the fucking carrot in front of me, but turns out there wasn't even a carrot there in the first place. 

I'm hopeless.

I feel helpless.

I don't know why I should keep going. The only thing that I was staying alive for over the last 5 months is a fucking lie, and doesn't exist. ",2.0

I wish I could have had that fun typical childhood or teenage life, but it's too late now. I'm going to be an adult soon, and it's too late to have those fun memories.

I wish I could never see my family again, but I don't want to bring them pain, even though they've done that to me without hesitation. I live in the house my mother built. A house built on agony and despair. 

The only people I cherish in my life are my sister and my boyfriend. They're wonderful, but I know that things don't last forever. Who knows until my boyfriend will stop loving me. My sister isnt obligated to help me, and I'd rather not open up to them about this and cause more pain.

"I'm done.Hello, my name is Bailey, I am 16 years old and I am a resident of the city Grants Pass, things have been very negative for me recently, I have grown up watching my mother, Chantel, get abused by my father. Recently my father has been coming into my room and sexually assaulting me. I've been raped, molested, and sodomized by my father, I have notified trustworthy adults about this and it hasn't helped. I am sick of this pain and suffering I am going through, and I think it's only fair to spread this pain and suffering to the rest of this cold, dark world we live in. I was also bullied severely at my last school, Grants Pass High. I have already committed to this plan and I will not be changing  my mind, I've shot and killed my brother last night with a newly purchased AR-15 purchased off the dark net via my computer.
His body is in the kitchen laying in the floor, I've also murdered my mother with a butchers knife only a few hours ago after having her tied up and kept in the basement since last night. I will continue this massacre in the morning, I will start off by bringing my AR-15 to my old school and killing as many people as I possible can, I have some good friends of mine planning to do the same to a few other school in the area such as, New Bridge High, South Middle School, Brighton Academy, and finally Gladiola Campus.
We've already had this plan in motion for a good bit of time now, we have multiple pipe bombs installed with timers planted randomly at each one of these schools, inside and outside of the buildings. Me and my friends will carry out these attacks on December 15th, at approximately 12 PM. Any attempts to stop me or any of my friends will go very badly for you if you try to take one of us out, any indication of something happening to one of my men will result in the detonation of every single bomb that we have planted in these areas.",2.0

"I don’t see the fucking pointI see for my future a life of mediocrity. I have no friends. People call me “interesting but hard to follow”. I scheduled a psychiatry appointment so I can finally get treatment for my cyclothymja and adhd. I’m on a 3 month waiting list now. Yay me. I can’t focus. My twin is on a trip across the country with my only friends and I wasn’t invited. I have no life of my own. I’m afraid I’m doomed to live life in my room and rot. Im a former athlete who can’t exercise. I have nothing to put passion into. I just joined a frat because I thought that would help but I still feel so disconnected from other people. I’m the only one reaching out to others. I don’t like my life. I want more from it. I have no passion for my major. I want to be better. I’ve had this thought for so long I don’t know if I can be. I’ve been trying but I always feel overwhelmed. I can’t keep my thoughts straight or who I am. I’m lethargic. I want to matter. I want a reason to matter. I feel like an accessory in the lives of others. 

I want to be better. And if I’m not I’d rather drive up to a bridge near here and jump. I know if I make the 40 minute drive and still do it then at least I’d have some clarity. It’s either I die now or I die later with only bitterness attached to my name. I don’t want to be my father. I want to be different. I wish I did things differently. I wish I was different. I wish I wasn’t such an asshole. I wish I was better. I tried to be better. But it’s just me. It’s a nice day. I just want to take a drive to that bridge.

This is probably going to sound like a bunch of rambling right now, I'm sure in part due to the fact that I'm drunk currently. Long story short: (I'll elaborate more soon but I feel like having the TL;DR in the beginning) I've wanted to kill myself for a long time, and I think about it every day. I've decided tonight, with what feels like a strange clarity of mind, that I will certainly take my own life, not tonight, but in the near future.

To elaborate:


For several years now, I realize that I've had a desire to end my own life, and now at this time, I have the most solid plan to do this than I ever have. I took out a life insurance policy out for ~60K on myself a while back, and I don't have many more months until the suicide clause expires on it. This amount should pay my debts and any (very minor) funeral expenses, although I don't want a funeral, I just want my corpse dumped somewhere that can either make use of it (like a body farm) or a place that will take very little money to dispose of this body. I know that I will make everyone I know's lives better when I'm dead, because I'm such a burden on them for even existing that logically I will only help once I'm dead. Since I've graduated high school in 2011, I've only made my life even worse with my crippling depression and anxiety, but I've also made the lives of several of my friends more difficult and inconvenient. I've ruined at least three romantic relationships with my mental health issues that I was too selfish to not keep to myself, and I'm at the lowest point I've ever been in life. Because of this, the only way I can see to make amends for the wrongs I've done to people in my life is to make sure I never do anything wrong and kill myself. They'll get over it quickly and I'll make sure the money is available to settle any outstanding debts. For anyone reading this I'm very, very sorry to have wasted your time. I don't know why I felt like typing this out in the first place. I hope everyone has a good day/evening. I'm sorry. ",2.0

"Want to kill myself, but I'm not allowed toI hate myself. I spend a decent amount of time on a seemingly daily basis wanting to kill myself. A large portion of these thoughts come from thinking of how I will/would ultimately ruin the life of any person I'm close to.

On the flip side of that, I have people whose lives would be severely impacted if I were to die. My roommate would be stuck with the full amount of our rent for the remaining 8 months of our lease, and since my parents signed on my car with me, they would owe the next 4 years of payments.

That's all I have when I think of reasons not to kill myself. Because I don't want other people to have to take on my debts if I'm dead.

So today, after a particularly bad episode, I took a look at what I own and tried to figure out how much I could sell it for. It's not a lot but I think I could sell everything I own and cover 2 months of rent and sell my car back to the dealer to pay off 60% of the loan.

That still doesn't seem fair of me to them, so then I thought maybe I could get a second job to work for a few months to make up the difference.

But then, I felt even worse because of how long it would take and how much more of my own mental bullshit I would have to endure.

No more worrying about girls or school or paying bills. No more thoughts about past trauma or the worries of future trauma. Do you ever wonder if life would be better without you that you’re a burden and people would be better off without you? Do you ever wish that the terrible things you’ve done would go away. That the pain would subside into nothingness. Do you ever wish you couldn’t feel anymore that life was just to much. This is all a part of life though I suppose. Yes there’s the bad but with it comes good too. I have my friends and family. I overall enjoy life if I’m not thinking about it to hard. Who would take care of my cat, how would my parents and friends feel if I did leave them in this world. Does this matter at all because I will never feel again and I will never know the pain I have caused from losing me. That’s not me though I want to be there for everyone.

"I can't forgive myselfNew here, using a throwaway account.

I've been struggling with mental health issues for a long time. I've gotten much better about being open and honest with friends and family, and I've received a lot of support from people who care about me.

My problem arises from the fact that I did some really repulsive, horrible things when I was a teenager. Everyone who knows me tells me I'm one of the most kind, caring people they know. This should make me feel better about myself and my situation, but I wind up feeling more angry and more hopeless every time someone tells me that, because they don't know what I've done, and if they did, they wouldn't want anything to do with me.

I guess I just don't know what the fuck to do anymore. I really don't plan on killing myself but the thought is in my head 24/7. I'm constantly fantasizing about how I'd do it, and where, and what I'd leave behind for people who know me. I hate myself for thinking that way because some of my friends and family have committed suicide in the past, and I still feel the empty, hollow feeling they've left behind. I would hate to let anyone else feel that same way, but sometimes I feel like I deserve it.

Recently I stopped drinking and doing drugs (I've never been a huge drug user, just semi-daily weed use and the occasional stimulant or psychedelic) in an attempt to gain better control over my emotions, but now I feel less in control than ever. I've set up a meeting with a therapist, but it's not for at least another week and I don't know if I can last that long without doing something stupid. I recently started self-harming after many years without it and I feel ashamed every time I make another cut on my arm.

The support that makes other people feel stronger just makes me feel like more of a worthless, shitty person. All these people put their faith in me and offered me their strength, and I've already let them down because of some idiotic decisions I made years and years ago.

I'm a bad person and I don't deserve anyone's love. How can I get that across to my friends? And how can I live with myself?",2.0

"I live with my ex and im about to end it [nsfw]I love her immensivly, we were together for a year. After we broke up she made out with two guys one which wad my worst enemy. She told me because she said she wanted to make me not want her. (We broke up together). She always asks me to move out, i want to. Its really hard because rent is super expensive i dont want to bother my mates. I have friends. I have looks. I have a muscular body. But i still want her and only her. I hate that i want her, even though she tries to hurt me.

I finger her at nights because she loves it and hs no control over it, i have sex with her then. After i feel empty and want to kms.

Today i got home from work. I layed in bed to sleep. She said she was cold and joined me and started groping her cold hands all over my body, especially my abs. I loved the attention. I then put my hands above her panties and rubbed her pussy for a bit. She then said ""you dont want to have sex with me."" ""Ive fucked another dude last night"". It hurt so bad i was already suicidal i feel heartbroke and empty. I fucked one girl after the breakup. It was good sex but i hated it either way. She keeps trying to hurt me but i love her. When we were together she was slutty and kept grinding on other people. She also hit me. A lot of times.  I never hit back. She keeps calling me a psychopath and i dont know if i am one. I havent felt remorse since 3rd grade. She says im manipulative and lying. I lie alot, i can agree with that. The manipulation has to be a sub concious act because i dont mean to.

"I legitimately cannot think of any reason suicide isn't okay.And I'm a therapist.

I always do my duty and encourage my clients to stay. I guide them to think of the possibilities, of what they're hoping for, of their potential. If need be, I have them evaluated for hospitalization.

But as someone who thinks about it often, I also feel like some of us are just going to keep suffering until we die. Especially those of us with chronic conditions that are extremely painful.

I feel like people should have the right to hold their own lives (and, thus, theirbown deaths) in their hands. Their body, their life, their choice.

Will others suffer? Yes. But we are not reaponsible for that. We are not reaponsible for surviving to keep others happy. We must do what we can to find happiness for ourselves, and sometimes we just can't do that, even if we've tried, and tried, and tried. Sometimes we have to know when to throw in the towel. Some of us are playing a losing game.

Have you heard of the sunk cost principle? In economics and business decision-making, a sunk cost (also known as retrospective cost) is a cost that has already been incurred and cannot be recovered. Sunk costs are contrasted with prospective costs, which are future costs that may be avoided if action is taken. Essentially, it's when you keep throwing money into a lost cause, as though you were on the Titanic and trying to toss buckets of water overboard as it rushes at you. Some of us live lives where it just costs too much -- emotionally, psychologically, etc -- to live.",2.0

You may think you have no one to go to or no one to trust, but there always is someone to talk too. It’s not worth killing yourself no matter how old you are, I if you need to talk then I am here, I will listen to whatever you have problems with, I know it sounds weird for me to say that since no one even knows me but if you need to talk we can we can trade things that happened to us and our names to prove that we’ve been through things and you’re not alone.

"*Triggering(Please do not read unless strong enough) Nobody cares about my story. Once I’m gone they will wonder why when I’ve tried to speak up over and over. Now I am numb.**Triggering story 
***Sorry if my grammar is not the best (typing from my phone) so here it goes... 

I’ve tried to take my life five times and only three out the five I was nearly successful. First off, I wanted to say I can not stand the ideology around people saying that ending your life is selfish. Also, when they try to throw your family and friends around as if guilting me will make me feel any better.

Since, I was younger I’ve always felt like I didn’t belong here or that I was an oddball. It’s like I stick out like a sore thumb everywhere I go letting the visions of those around me haunt my mind as time goes by.

I’ve been sexual assaulted more times than I can count from a old childhood friend’s brother. Growing up only got worst as I was in two uncontrollable events in which I got raped at the age of fourteen and then nineteen when I was in college. 

I actually had got pregnant and then endured a series of two miscarriages from that situation. I was pregnant with twins while still trying to maintain being a college athlete and keep up my GPA. 

They dismissed what happened to me both times family the first time and my old college the second. 

However, the one question that tends to stick me is “Why do they care if I leave this earth” my therapist in quote said to me at the age of twenty “I’ve lived through more trauma that could last a life time in which she does know if she could overcome” and then she went to say “.... you are so strong”.


As I look back at my trauma and counting it’s unbearable. Especially with everything going on as an African American female I can honestly admit I feel like I’m truly losing it. Every breath I take feels like thousands of boulders crushing my lungs... 

My cries are silent. My cries are never heard I’m hushed along the way trying to make it in today’s society. All of my dreams fades into fantasies as it feels like I’ll never overcome this.


So that question that lingers “Why do they care if I leave this earth” will always bother me for the sake that I care for everyone but myself. Selfish I think not for the only reason I don’t just jump is for the sake of others and their feelings... Never mines though.

I feel like a waste of space just collecting time before I go. I’m twenty-one and everyday feels harder and harder so what now? I’ve been hospitalized around nine times. I’m still in college going with the motions.


I’m struggling to barely get out of bed. So what now?

Currently homeless, and have been off and on the past three years. Due to physical conditions (let alone mental), I am incapable of working more then 15-20 hours a week. Based on that I'll probably be homeless for at least another two years, assuming I successfully applied for social security and disability right now.

Long story short, I always have suii thoughts, but lately there's more planning involved in my thoughts. I just don't think I can live like this anymore. Being homeless makes you feel less then human, looked down upon by everyone else in society.

I'm not looking for anyway to talk me down or try to solve my issues. I simply want a friend to talk with about boring day to day shit. Even living in a shelter surrounded by over 100 other dudes, I've never felt more alone.

"Plans all set but can't find the courage to do it.No need for description really. I've suffered from depression since i was a child. At 17-19 i went thru a bad relationship with a girl who was out of my league an she knew it. She constantly shit on me an treated me like crap.

Fast forward 12 years I'm married but separated as if 1 month ago. All of it is due to me not being emotionally there an not showing appreciation to my wife. I end up have anxiety/panic attacks start 4 years ago. 

All of this piles into me having zero self worth or self esteem. This last month has pushed me into a very dark hole i have been mildly suicidal before in my early 20s. But this time is worse I've actually made a plan purchased needed items an have the area set up but lacking the courage.

I can not live without my wife but at the same time i hate holding her back. I've voiced my thoughts of wanting to die an she only says things like ""you better not harm yourself at all."" Or ""I'll never forgive you!"" I know i hurt her but when I'm in my depression stage I'm like a zombie in the world i don't notice stuff or signs. I've told her i take all the blame but i want her to talk to me an to try to work this out but she has zero interest in fixing it. I

I've lasted this last month on shear willpower hoping i could fix it. Few weeks back she tells me shes 100% done. An i honestly blocked it out for a few days then had a massive breakdown. Since then I've just wanted to die everyday to the point that I've wrote my letter an gathered needed materials.

I know we are told not to be descriptive but i have to say my plan. 

My plan is to mix a few sleeping aides in excessive amount wait till i start to get tired then get in place[a tree in my backyard] an send out my letter on social media. Then just wait till i pass out an hang myself.

I asked him through tears “why would you say that” and he said “why would YOU say you wanted to kill yourself. I’m not saying sorry either, because I meant it.” And that broke me. I’m mentally troubled. My meds aren’t working yet since I just got them. I’m schizoaffective, depressed, anxious, bipolar, and have PTSD. So if it’s not apparent, I’m a very troubled person. I’m not currently getting any *good* therapy because.. well.. it’s complicated and I’ll spare you the details. Just know it’s.. really complicated and it isn’t as easy as “go get a new therapist!” Life isn’t always that easy, unfortunately. Right now I’m focusing on meds. Since my bipolar and depression are the main things harming me. And my boyfriend. And everyone I ever speak to. I’m a wreck of a human being. I ran upstairs to go find my mothers gun but I couldn’t find it. I sat down and cried for about 20 minutes. Then I stabbed myself in the stomach with a knife. But I’m too weak (mentally and physically) to stab myself any deeper than something very minor. I tried doing it again in the same spot but it only went a little bit deeper. I broke down again at how weak I am and sat down on the kitchen floor in tears. I’m planning on taking every pill in the house. I know that’s more so going to cause internal damage or.. brain damage. But I don’t care. If there’s a chance I will die or be unconscious for a long period of time, imitating death.. then I’ll go through with it. My boyfriend said if I did it he’d hate me. But he already said he hated me. So what exactly am I going to lose? Him hating me *more*? So be it. Not like I’ll be here to know he hates me and will never forgive me.

Please don’t think he’s uncaring by what he said. He only said it because he *does* care and I was getting out of hand. Though I don’t agree with him saying it, I’m trying to find reasoning behind his hurtful words in one of the worst times of my life. I hate me too. And I’m already done swallowing 10 of my mood stabilizers. It’s all I had in the bottle. I’ll do the antidepressants a little later. I’m dizzy.

"I’m a failure at everything I doAs we approach the end of the year I can’t help but look back on all my life failures. I don’t want to bore anyone with my story so I’ll try to keep it short: ever since I was a sophomore in high school I wanted to write. I studied and honed my craft through high school and college before getting my degree a couple of years ago. That same year I got an internship at a start-up that abused me as an employee and I ended up quitting to find a closer job near me. There are no writing jobs close to home so I had to work graveyard at a market while writing my first novel and applying for my Masters. During this time my mom went into cardiac arrest and existed in a vegetative state for two years before passing away this past June. Around this same time my dad also needed open heart surgery and I was forced to quit my job to take care of him. I’m 26 now and I’ve written three books, a bunch of short stories and poems too. All of them have seen nothing but rejection no matter how much I polish or edit. 

Every time I can’t seem to make some kind of step forward in my goal of becoming an author, I break down. I used to think that I would teach at a college level but I couldn’t get into my dream school and I’ve been lead to believe that I’m not really cut out to be a teacher. Everyone I’ve told my story to has given me the same responses: to get a day job doing something else, which I did, but I haven’t had a job with a good enough income to support myself and the idea of working a job that I’m not passionate about seems counterintuitive. They also tell me that I was naive to think that a degree would be enough to get me anywhere professionally, but that does nothing for my current predicament and all anybody ever tells you is to follow your passions, which is what I did. 

I see no hope for myself. If I could kill myself I would but I’m afraid of hurting my girlfriend, my dad, my nieces and my sister. I struggled through five years of college to come out a failure, unable to sustain myself and I’m afraid that by the middle of 2020 I’ll be dead because I won’t have the strength to carry myself or my idiotic dreams.",2.0

Had i not been up, My dad had thought I had broken a cup or something and wasnt going to bother checking, I was known for having insomnia at this point in my life already, so she may very well have attacked any one of us that night.",1.0
"He’s bled me dry and won’t stopTo keep this succinct, I am partway through a divorce from my husband and every step of the way, he’s taking more and more from me financially to the point that I’d have been better off on benefits for my entire working life than having worked so fucking hard for 22 years - since I was 14.

On a personal level he’s taken me to the cleaners because I earned more than him. Oh, we had exactly the same day rate (as both self employed contractors) but throughout our marriage he chose to not actually work and therefore not earn anything - but had no problem spending literally hundreds of pounds of my money in a single night getting pissed and trying to fuck strippers.

And now the company we shared - that he put no money into - and I left a year ago - still needs taxes paying and I genuinely will be in court and lose my career because he can’t pay his share even though I’ve paid my own...because the tax man doesn’t give a shit who paid what...company still fucking owes!!

I genuinely don’t think that it’s worth even trying any more. I may as well just pay my wages directly to him and be done with it. And still potentially end up on the wrong side of the law. After trying so hard in life. What’s the point. I’ll lose my house over it this time no doubt. I don’t even want to fucking try any more. ",2.0

"Possibly my final noteI’ve been writing suicide notes but I’ve been too much of a coward to go through with it and I feel like my friends have been there more than my family who is supposed to be with you but in my situation that is completely bullshit. 3 years is when I reached out for help to my parent but not had happened. I was promised to talk to a therapist but it was just something to make feel better at the moment. After realising promises are made to be broke I’ve developed trust issues like I am afraid to love to the person I love best but I am afraid that she sees this side of me that I’ve keep to myself I love her but she deserves more. My first suicide note I tried to go through with it but I fucking failed that like I fucked up everyone and everything tonight I’ve come to realise I should end it, like cutting the chain I’ve attached to everyone in my life because I am just dead weight

I have no motivation to do school work and the amount of work is just piling up making it harder to be able to complete assignments and I cant do this.

If my parents found out about her I wouldnt be able to talk to her.

"I don't know what to do, I don't know who to talk to, I hate everything more every dayI'm sorry if this just seems like incoherent ramblings...

I think more about suicide or just getting up and leaving every day. I think I'm too much of a baby to actually go through with it but I spend a lot of time just imagining what it would be like.

I don't know how to talk to my boyfriend about my feelings. Every time I begin to have the courage to bring it up, he's able to talk me down into ""it's just a phase"", ""our situation is just shitty right now...it'll get better"", and I find myself agreeing with him but not feeling any better.

My best friend once told me she thinks ""suicide is for cowards"", and part of me agrees but part of me knows she could never know what this feels like, when food has no taste and nothing makes you happy. And now, I barely get to talk to her at all. Her boyfriend consumes every second of her life.

My mom would have a hysterical break down, and I don't want to do that to her. I love her very much and there's nothing she is able to do for me right now, so telling her what's on my mind would only cause unneeded stress.

I love my cats. I love video games and music and watching movies and drawing. But I don't love any of it as much any more. It's affecting my work (I'm trying, and failing, to be an artist) and my ability to be the happy me that everyone knows, the one that never stops smiling or never has a bad day. All I hear anymore is ""are you ok?"" ""you seem irritated"" ""what's wrong?""

Everything is wrong. I'm in a hole and I'm too tired to dig myself out of it. I'm weak and I don't know how to be stronger. I want to choose a road and keep walking until I can't anymore. I'm bound to this world by the guilt I would feel for leaving people behind. But guilt doesn't do anything if you're dead.

I have a lot more in my life than others do...it's selfish of me to be thinking this way, but it's been a persistent scratch at the back of my head since I was younger, and my life was much darker. Suicide has not once left my mind for a good 6 years.

"whateverIn 120 years from now all 7 something billion people currently alive on this planet will be dead, every single one. Life is so short and fleeting and yet everyone is obsessing over trivial nonsense. Every plight, every joy, every memory and every experience we go through will vanish once we're dead, in 120 years from now everyone currently alive will be but a memory for the next generations to come, and even then 100 years later the vast majority of us will have been completely forgotten, virtually erased from the universe.

I'm still scared to share too much but I'm trying to say enough that people could at least reply to me and maybe help a bit.

I'm financially and physically destroyed from a previous suicide attempt a couple months ago.

My only friend and ex-boyfriend abandoned me because he couldn't handle someone like this in his life. I caused too much pain. I just brought him down and he needed to live for himself. I don't have any other friends or people to talk to.

I went to a psychiatrist and he put me on Prozac. It's not working. I still spend every minute wishing the pain would go away. This doesn't feel like a regular emotional problem like transient depression - it feels like a chemical imbalance that makes it impossible for me to feel anything but terrible emotions. It feels like I'm unable to experience joy anymore. So you'd at least expect antidepressant drugs to work, but after a number of weeks I'm still just as broken.

I really want to get help and get better, but it isn't working.

Dying seems like a sensible way out. Being this broken and constantly hurting emotionally and physically makes it difficult to find things that make life worth living. Or impossible, I guess - it fucks with my mind enough that I can't do anything to distract me and bring joy. Even writing this post is extremely hard on me from a purely cognitive level.

I feel like I need someone to talk to who cares, even a little bit. But that kind of friendship takes years (or at least months) to develop, and I have really neglected my social life. How do you find people in a situation like that?

 I'm the kind of person who used to hang out on /r/suicidewatch and try to help people, but now I feel hopeless to help myself. I can't even remember what it felt like to not be like this, when I had the heart to try to talk others down from similar pain.",2.0

"It’s not at all comforting that you can relateIt’s great that I’m not alone in this and all, but think about that. There’s all these people that want to end it so there must be good reason. I say I want friends, that I want out. How can you have friends when you can barely handle yourself? “Pm me” they say. “We can chat, I know how you feel” But I can’t. I can’t communicate with other human beings because I know at the end of the day we’re all selfish, and that you will abandon me, think I’m weird, hate me even. I can’t talk to you because one more disappointment will be one too many. I have to be isolated. Depressed. Suicidal. Because to live a normal, happy life just isn’t in me. I can put on the act of being normal, but I’m just acting. I don’t even know who I am. So how could you possibly relate?",2.0

"Tired and Found Solace in Suicidal ThoughtsThis isn't really new to me. I imagine killing myself in different ways. I don't have a concrete plan but the outline kind of goes like this. Buy a gun, drive far away and walk into a forest and find a nice spot to return my body to the earth. Here are some problems; I fail or quit at everything I attempt. I don't remember the last time I was genuinely happy. I don't trust anyone because I always think of the evil in everybody. My mind goes on autopilot whenever I talk to people in person and I hate touching other people and when other people touch me. There are more than that but I think you get the idea.                I probably have a mental disorder other than depression. I never have gone to therapy or take medication for anything. I don't know what I want, maybe someone here can say something that might help me. ",2.0

"How my disease is making me want to kill myself more and more everyday.I've been diagnosed with Chrolinergic urticaria about a year ago, according to the doctors it happened for one of two reasons. A, my cat that I loved more than myself, and had to give her away for that reason which took a toll on me. B, that one time I tried Meth with a friend of mine, one night. Its a small shot but it could cause it. If you've no idea what the disease does, basically it creates hives all over my body every time my temperature rises. I live in a very hot country (United Arab Emirates) and it can get as hot as 50 degrees on a normal day. I stopped going to University, I stopped hanging out with all of my friends, haven't left the house in months now because of the heat. Being the only male in the house with 5 females (Mother and four sisters) I can no longer help them, with either driving or the heavy duty carrying as that would trigger the hives. The pain feels like a million stabs all at once and it hurts like fuck to the point where I can only curl on the floor and take it. I've tried several medications and UV light treatment but none of them helped. I can't take it anymore. I used to be able to get my mind off it by playing video games all the time but now it feels more like a chore, I play video games to not get attacked and I longer find joy even in my favorite games. I can barely sleep for more than three hours a day also because of it, as these random attacks occur while im sleeping and wake me up. Some nights the only way to sleep is to cry myself down. I can't take it anymore, I'm gaining weight, disease is getting worse, and my methods of cooling it down are starting to lose effect. I've never felt more dead inside and every day suicide feels like my only choice, I no longer want to live like this. This is my suicide note, this is what my family and friends will read after its done. I'm sorry to everyone I've hurt or will hurt but I'm doing this for myself. I blame no one, so please don't think that I wouldn't have killed myself if you've done something different. Thank you for taking the time reading this. Its 2:31 PM right now, I'll be gone by midnight. Goodbye.

"How to talk to people about an attempt...I recently tried taking my life by overdosing, luckily I did not do too any research and what I tried od'ing on only made me intoxicated, or high, and without any side effects so far. Regardless, I have not told anyone about this, and I am not sure how to tell anyone, I do see a therapist, but work has got in the way, and I believe that partially contributed to my mindset sinking so low. I've always had thoughts, but the other day was the first time I have acting upon them. I was too embarrassed to even go into work having thoughts of paranoia that someone might know, and I have lost my job. I haven't talked to anyone in a few days, friends have tried reaching out, but I haven't worked up the courage to reply, school has been rough, but I have been able to show up and leave, and put on a brave face. I'm just looking for some guidance from someone. I'm not sure how to tell anyone, especially my parents and my therapist. I don't want them to think anything of me because of this. Thanks in advanced, in means the world to me. And if you are reading this and are thinking poorly, please do not attempt it. It is not worth it. ",2.0

"Does hanging hurt less if you’re really drunk?I’m a “recovering” alcoholic. Life is too much for me. I tried to buy a gun a few weeks ago, but my permanent address (and drivers license) is in a different state; I’m a college student. I always swore a gun is the only way I’d go because it’s foolproof, but I can’t do this anymore. 

I know hanging is not an ideal death unless you do it just right and snap your neck. Well I fuck everything up in life, so I assume I’d manage to fuck that up too. Would the pain be less or would I be likely to pass out quicker so at least the suffering was over if I was very drunk? I also have a Xanax prescription - if I took a bunch to relax myself would it make the process easier?

I live in the mountains. I’d go to the woods. My house isn’t very tall inside. I’d leave a note and I’d tell all my friends I love them before I go...because I do, but I can’t take it anymore. None of them understand. I know people will be sad and traumatized and it’s selfish so please, save your breath with that. I am in such a dark place I don’t care who I hurt. I always get really depressed and think about it, but it’s different this time. I’be finally reached the depressive episode I won’t make it out of.

"all I want is mercy and peaceI'm exhausted. For the past near two decades I have been so miserable. I can't connect to people -- they scare me so much, and they are loud. Always in my ear buzzing about their emotions and urges. They keep hissing it out me, like I did something wrong. 

I'm just trying to eat, but there are others in the cafeteria, and they are all thinking about me. They are all directing their pains onto me!

All I do is daydream. In class, work, with friends, or in bed, I am in my fantasy world. 

You should see me there! I'm happy, successful, and happy. I find love in my little world. I have someone to nuzzle up to, and she loves me. 

All I have here-physically is a pillow that my hugs and clutches are wearing holes into. 

Meds don't help me. My therapist got a new job. My best friends moved far away a few months ago. I've fallen in love with one of them. 

There is no joy -- nothing seems good to me anymore. I can't laugh like I used to. I can't smile like I used to. I still have those, but they're masks now. I made them carefully. And they make me seems human for a little while. 

I'm no person. I'm past defective. I'm not what everybody else is. 

Coward! Everyone calls me one. I am one. I couldn't pull the trigger. I'm not man enough. I want to die. Please have mercy. Please let me be. Please, please, please, help me go out peacefully. 

Don't walk in on my bloody body. Don't. Just please sit by me as I fall asleep and never wake up. 

WHY SHOULD I BE EXPECTED TO GO THROUGH THIS EVERY DAY. THIS WILL NEVER END. 

I've tried it all. 

No respect for a stain like me.

"I don’t know where to go from hereHad a visceral nightmare where I was r**** and it just reminded me of past abuse, since then I can’t go more than a few hours without a panic attack.
Didn’t go to work these last few days because of it and I’m scared shitless that they’re gonna fire me over it because no one takes mental health seriously.
Tried calling some phone number but they told me they would send emergency services since I self harmed and had suicidal thoughts and I can’t fucking afford to be wheeled to the hospital. 
No one listens unless you’re bout to take that jump and when you are they just house you up in a little room with no privacy like a zoo animal.

"My date with the Suicide Forest.I've actually gone past the area when I was in Japan but I never actually ventured in.

This year there are two movies, The Forest and Sea of Trees. Dormer in the first, McConaughey in the second. 

This has really spoken to me and I can see myself doing this. It's not endorsed by any means of course, but apparently if you veer off the beaten path, it is *understood* and you are more or less left alone. You stay in there and figure things out and if you still want to die there, it's your prerogative.

There's a dignity in the sense that you take your backpack and you hike in there. You climb over the regular path into the forest. You are then in your own hands. The forest rangers regularly go through the forest and if they come upon you, your privacy is respected.

I don't really want to bother living through all this pain for a glimpse of happiness just to die anyway. I know it's not all as hard as this, but my point is: this isn't even hard.

"A ludicrous yet serious story that is cause me anxiety and sadnessI don't know how many of you will read this, but I really feel the need to write because I think I am on the verge of a mental breakdown: 
I am a guy in my early 20s and sometimes I have considered committing suicide beacuse I feel stuck in a meaningless life, and I cannot see a ray of sun in this darkness.
A couple of days ago, probably out of despair/depression, I decided to tell a girl a follow on IG that she is the most beautiful I have ever seen; actually we don't know each other and she lives far from me; without (high) expectations I asked if she would consider having a coffee when she travels somewhere near me (she travels frequently) and she politely declined (understandably I guess).
I realise this whole thing is ludicrous and pathetic, but her reply caused a sadness that is shattering me; I don't know how to explain this feeling but I experience a growing sense of anxiety, and I don't know how to deal with it.

"The pactAbout a year ago, I was suicidally depressed (actually, most of my life). I decided to write a pact with 3 attainable goals:
1. Find a job
2. Find someone 
3. Become fit (I was normal/skinny)

If I failed I decided I would kill myself to stop being a burden on my family/society (they have enough burdens as it is)

A year has passed, I finished college and my internship, but I've been unemployed for 6 months (I've lost count of how many jobs I've applied to in many different fields). I'm about to run out of money and I'm 18k in debt (thanks school). 

I have a family but I can't return back home, mainly because of my deadbeat alcoholic father who doesn't do anything, and tells everyone else in my family that they're not doing shit (can't say anything about it to him, he's extremely mentally unstable, will snap and take it out on my mother). It makes me physically ill to be around him (hes put my mother and my sister through hell). Every time he talks to me or even touches me a killing intent rises in my body.

I'm more alone now than ever, I've actually lost the bulk of my friends (they moved, found jobs, etc), and I'm nowhere close to being mentally stable enough to sustain a relationship with someone. I have self-esteem and confidence issues even though I've been told by several people that I'm physically attractive (even other guys tell me I'm attractive). I am more muscular than I was last year, but I'm not fit, In fact I feel like shit most of time and I was actually more fit last year (cardiovascular wise). 

I'm 23 now, I'm socially retarded, unemployed (seemingly unemployable), in debt, all the standard depressed reasons. I don't really want to kill myself, but I know exactly how and when I'm going to do it. I just don't know what to do anymore, and I know its my fault. I didn't work hard enough in school, I didn't do anything to change my family, and I didn't develop my social skills. I failed. ",2.0
"Overbearing parents.. Losing control. Please help.As a 20+yold living with parents I realize there isn't much liberty for me to live how I want to, and there are rules for me to abide by while I live under their home. While I am looking for a job, and have gotten an internship atm, this is not enough to satisfy my parents expectations. It's difficult when everything I do seems wrong in their eyes. From the way I do chores, to simply request some time for myself, if I don't do things up to their standard I am to blame. And they certainly make it known to me, insulting me by showing what a failure I am. I lost all confidence in myself because of these talks with my parents, because I feel that I am always to blame for every action or disharmony. 

While looking for work, all I ask is simply to be able to use the Internet freely on three days. Some days out of the week I get some freedom. And I cherish this privilege. But tonight, a night that I mentioned was one of those nights, without saying a word, they removed that privilege and just got rid of the modem. I mentioned to them before that we should have clarity in our expectations and clearly this wasn't clarified. I feel like they are imposing their decisions on my life and I find it extremely difficult to maintain my independence. 

I am looking for work. I want to just move out. I want my freedom. But I'm finding it difficult to live up to my parents expectations of me. I have trouble making my own decisions because I will never be able to please them. If I say something to them, they say I'm not listening or I'm just saying it as a cop out. I lost all credibility in their eyes and I feel like nothing I say matters. Nothing I do matters.

My mom sometimes brings home junk food, and I end up eating it then hating myself more. To add to my hatred, I have scars on my body. One time I tried cutting.

"Low GPA issues, want to jump off a building or in front of a trainHey folks,  


I am an electrical engineering student who has an incredibly low GPA score (3.792 on a scale of 7 which is equal to a 2.160 on a scale of 4). I have completed 3 semesters out of a 4 year degree however, my GPA is far too low for anyone other than the smallest startups to take me in.

"One stupid mistake have ruined my life.Hello. If someone would've asked me three weeks ago how I was doing I would've said ""great"". One mistake later and I am now suicidal. 

I was on vacation in thailand with a friend of mine. One night we were out clubbing and we both got hammered. I met a local girl in a nightclub and one thing led to another and we ended up spending the night together. In the morning as she was about to leave she stopped for a second and told me it was time to pay. I was chocked as she had not told me this the night before. I somehow got the strength to pay her after a few minutes of confusion. After she had left I was still in chock. A few minutes passed and I came to a realisation what has happened. I got the impulse to just jump off the balcony but I stopped last minute. I was in complete panic. My first worry was the moral issue. I has just payed for sex. I didnt know I was doing that but it had never the less happened. My second thought was that she might have given me HIV. This was 16 days ago. Since them I've come home, told my parents. Seen a doctor a few times. Started taking anti depressive yesterday. I've also started taking sleeping pills. In one month from now I Will find out if I have HIV or not. If I've got HIV then I cant live with myself. IF I dont have it I still dont think I can live with myself. I have considered suicide every night since I got home. The only thing stopping me is my family. I cant eat. I barely sleep. I cant take much more. All because I was a little tio drunk and was foolish enough not to realise she was a prostitute. I'm 21 and my life is over. All because of one drunken mistake.i",2.0

"I had a panic attack at work...I finished by 1st real week of work at the miserable Wal-Mart and I had a panic attack for the 1st time in public.

I was the only one scheduled to work produce that day (on a fucking holiday mind you.) and I was expected to just know what to do despite the only two other produce workers showing fuck all but stocking fruits and veggies.

For 2 hours straight I had to keep the produce aisle clean, tell people where stuff was (assuming that I knew where EVERYTHING was) as well as restocking other produce at the same time.

The corn was getting low so I had to pull that giant pallet of corn out of the freeze and put it on the store floor.

It was wet and slippery in the room outside of the freezer, so I slipped and fell.

Hurt myself pretty bad and then burst into tears and become inconsolable for about 10 minutes.

I only regain composure because I saw someone coming to see what the noise was.

I played it off and just asked her for help to remove the pallet from the doorway.

It was only after my 1st break did one of the only two produce guys come in to aid me, and the one that came in had that day off.

So if I didn't tell anyone I was supposed to be working alone, today would have gone so much worse.

I wanted to fucking die right then and there, expecting a noobie like me to just fucking know what to do only after being here for less then one full week...

And even after telling my mother this she still won't let me quit...

I'm starting to think myself I just need to show this suicidal entries to my step father...

I mean I got nothing to lose at this point, my family becoming homeless is looking like more and more of a reality...

My meaningless paycheck isn't going to be enough to bail us out.

"I can't stop thinking about itJust like the title says

I have been living with major ptsd for over 20 years stemming from some messed up stuff that happened to me as a child. I feel so hopeless and tired and scared and alone and broken beyond repair. Every day, to one degree or another, I think about killing myself. I have been in therapy for about 5 years now and things had gotten better in recent years but these feelings never go away, not completely. Even when things are going well, and I feel happy and I'm functioning well and I'm feeling like life is ok and I might have a chance to feel like a normal human being and achieve the things I sometimes think I want, the voice in my head urging me to kill myself is still there, just very quiet. Even in these times where things are going well, I have to live with the knowledge that when I go to sleep at night, I have no idea how I'm going to feel when I wake up in the morning or if I'll wake up an hour later drenched in sweat in a full on fucking panic attack. That in itself is taxing on the mind. When things get bad, it's insufferable. The major depressive episodes and major ptsd instances have become fewer and farther between in recent years but in the last few weeks, I've been in hell and I don't know if I can make it through this time. I have been through episodes like this before, this is nothing new, but I'm tired of living like this. I know this will be the rest of my life. Every moment right now there is a loud intrusive voice telling me to kill myself. I can't focus on anything. I'm fucking up at work and I just cut off relationships with my parents and the only woman I ever met who understands me and my issues and I ever felt a real connection to. Everything is falling apart this time and part of me is devastated and the other part knows its for the best. I am not looking for answers here. There are no answers.

"I can't handle it anymoreI grew up and still live in an abusive household, and i still endure it every day. I've had depression for years and it started to get worse 2 years ago with a lot of deaths in my social circle, extreme loneliness and several other factors.
My depression causes sleeping problems and concentration problems, which makes it hard to study. Because of this i will probably fail my last year . My parents are hammering me down because of my grades getting worse , which amplifies my depression and thus starting a vicious circle amplifying itself. My parents will either kick me out or beat the living hell out of me if i don't succeed or both. I've got nowhere to go and i can't tell them or my friends because it will worsen the situation. I've already lost friends because of my depression.  I've tried to kill myself twice now, once by OD'ing on painkillers and my most recent attempt was cutting my wrists. My depression is getting worse and the thought of ending myself is always there. I can't deal with my situation anymore and i want to end it all. There is only 1 person who cares about me, on the other side of the world, and she would never know if i killed myself. So why should i stay here?",2.0
"Is today the day?I’m debating on ending it.  I don’t fit in to this world.  I look around and I’m not a carefree partier like all the other college age kids.  I suck at being my age.  I’ll never have anyone special.  I look at all these spoiled housewives who’s husbands do any and everything for them (work, pay for them to be pampered and go on exotic vacations, cook for them, clean, etc) and I know I’ll never be valuable enough for someone to wrap the world up in a pretty package, set it at my feet, and cater to my every whim.  
I have a hard time relating to kids my age and that puts a serious damper on the whole “make friends” and “date” thing.  The friends I DO have treat me badly and only talk to me or respond to me when it’s convenient or when they need something.  I have no reason to believe a spouse wouldn’t treat me that same way since it seems obvious that I’m not worth being good to even though I have ALWAYS tried to be a good friend to others.  Meanwhile I watch people who were mean to me when I was a child and they are doing so well in life.  I just feel like I am abnormal, there’s things wrong with me, I don’t matter, I don’t belong, I will never be happy, and the ONLY thing I want anymore is to leave this world and let everyone else go on partying.
I hate my job.  My family isn’t there for me.  When I try to tell my mom I just get all this rot about how I can choose to be happy and if I’ve made a dumb decision (seems like every decision I make is bad) it just goes back to an “I told you so!  You didn’t listen!”

"I need immediate help.I'm a 19 year old boy, and have been heavily depressed and suicidal since I was 12, when I for the first time, tried hanging myself. 

I've been seeking help since age 14, but with no great succes.
For the last years I've failed different educations, because of my mental condition which is slowly tearing me apart. 

I am constantly imagining guns to my head, ropes around my neck, the ground smashing my body, etc. and it haunts me, even when I'm in a somewhat good mood. 

About a year ago when I help finally came, I was by mistake diagnosed as a schizophrenic. I had to walk around with this dagnosis hanging over my head, and swallow anti-psychotics that would eventually make me fall asleep in the middle of every morning classes. After a half year, I demanded a new diagnosis because I've NEVER been psychotic.
After a single conversation with a leading doctor, I was diagnosed with dystymia and heavy depressions.

I was prescribed prozac, and when I started on 30mg things suddenly became joyful. I was open-hearted, I was happy and I had confidence. While everything suddenly was going well, I decided to drop acid with some friends (all of us with an already daily usage of cannabis) It was wonderful and for the next 2 weeks I was happy. I dumped by girlfriend through 2 years at the time. I was certain that I would start from scratch. All of a sudden girls were attracted to me. I had no problems getting laid, and my friends' jealousy, was a sign to me that I was on the right track. I was sure that the days of my suffering had end, and I could finally be happy.
For some reason ONE weekend could destroy all those thoughts. I've had the best days of school ever. As another weekend approached everything went great. But after the weekend, I was back in school and NO ONE seemed as happy as me. Suddenly depression hit me. I was lonely again. Yeah I was happy, but no one around me were. Ever since then I've been extremely depressed. I'm losing friends and I'm losing my grip. It seems to all start over again. For the last month I've tried suicide 5 times. Last time yesterday. My only will is to die in peace. I am a lonely soul.",2.0

Suicidal does not equal selfish

Depression makes you feel like a burden
Like the world would be better without you in it

You arent a bad person for feeling this way

Suicide = severe mental distress

You are human. People want to commit suicide want the pain to stop.

If someones pet had terminal illness, and weren't likely to survive a surgery, they often think that putting them down is the kindest thing to do.

If a human is terminally ill, they can choose not to proceed with any more treatment because they want to die in peace.

It's okay to be skeptical of your happiness, of life. I also know that you have so much strength and the human brain can change. It's hard to practice self care to try to regulate your mental state when you have mental illness. Especially if you dont have the motivation or dont feel like you deserve it. 

I dont know you, but I know and I strongly believe that you do deserve happiness. Even if the odds are stacked against you, I will still believe in you. Even if the people around you dont appreciate you. Dont understand you. Dont support you. I believe you have value.",2.0

"Day 3Hey guys, 

I'm surprised I'm still doing these updates, I honestly thought I would of given up after like one or two posts. This is a new achievement for me. 

First of all I just want to say thank you for all your support and concern, Ive had a lot of messages asking if I seen therapists or psychologists and yes, plenty! Tbh I think it's countless how many professionals Ive seen for my mental health. 

Anyway today was pretty unsuccessful. I didnt go to work, I slept all day and spent all day on my pc playing The Division and lying to everyone I know. I was suppose to see my ex tonight for a movie after work but I told him I was working too late and wasnt feeling up to it. Another guy from work who is obsessed with me also asked if I would see him for coffee and I ignored his message. 
Seeing people makes me so uncomfortable. 

I blocked both of them on my social media, including steam and just played games all day. 

That's it. My day was a typical day for me; ignore everyone and distract myself with games. 
I thought about death only once today and it was about how I'm going to tell my Mum. She hasnt contacted me directly (except through legal letters) in about a month so I'm sure she won't care I'm gone or already thinks i am. Eh, I might leave it alone and not tell her. 
I also need to some how work up the mental strength to go outside and simply get a note pad and pen so I can start writing my goodbye letters to those who I feel needs one. 
It's silly that I have to mentally prepare myself to be in public, I get so anxious and think everyone is staring at me or judging me. I feel so stupid. I can't even get groceries, I usually just get food delivered but it chews through my cash. 
Anyway, I said I wouldn't make this as long as I did yesterday so as always, good vibes to you all. ",2.0

Is this just another guy who made me fall in love with him and think that he loves me and cares about me, and he actually doesn´t give a damn about me?"" I don´t want to have these thoughts, so I try to stop myself from thinking about that all, but sometimes I just can´t stop and I feel too bad ( for no real reason actually because I honestly feel like he loves me a lot. ).

"It's just getting a lot harder and I'm worried.Hello people. Last spring semester of university I was withdrawn with a medical withdrawal due to depression and serious consideration of suicide. I moved home and after the summer enrolled in my hometown's university. As the last two semesters have passed, I've felt myself slowly slipping back into my depression. I thought I was better, damn it. I know that sounds silly to think I got over it so quickly, but I really fucking did. Things are going all right for me. I'm lined up to transfer back to the university I was originally at for this Fall semester. I'm going to have a decent GPA this semester. My family dynamic is still really fucked, but I've got a decent support system. I still want to die, though, and I've thought about exactly how I'd do it. I'm the only one home this week, due to finals. I have work tomorrow in the afternoon. I could do the old hose/exhaust thing in my truck tomorrow after my family leaves, and my family would find me when they got home around six pm. Maybe I'll drive to this secluded wooded area I know within a mile or two from my home and do it there, so my family doesn't discover me. I don't really like them, but I don't think I should fuck them up with my stuff. It just hurts. I don't even know why it hurts. But yeah, to wrap this up, apologies for the ramble.

As I mentioned, I have received some emergency assistance in the form of loans through /r/borrow, for which I am beyond grateful. But though they provide temporary relief, the loans themselves just end up being part of this vicious circle and mire me even deeper in the debt I’m trying to escape. I know more loans aren’t the answer. So I’m looking for a different kind of help.",1.0

"I believe I’m transgender, feeling hopeless and in an extremely dark place right nowSo I don’t really know where to begin, whether this is the right sub to be posting this on or not. I’ve never talked about this with anyone but I believe that I am transgender. I am a 20 year old woman. I’ve struggled with my gender on and off for a long time. The next thing I’m going to say is very bad and I know how bad it is and what I’ve done but I have to say it. I catfished as a man online and was in an online relationship for 8 months. My “girlfriend” found out tonight and I am in a very bad way. As far as they know, I’m still a man, just not the person in the pictures. It’s better that way. I know how shitty of a person I am, I don’t need to hear it. I don’t know why I did what I did, I just know that I felt more myself as someone else then I ever have as myself. I’m sitting here an hour later and I am horribly conflicted. I basically lived 2 lives. My online life where I was a straight man and my real life where I am a straight woman. I am miserable. The only thing keeping me happy was this online life. Which has now ruined my life again. There are so many pieces to this puzzle that just get worse and worse. I’m a shitty person and I hate myself. Transitioning isn’t an option, I would be shunned by my dad and I don’t have the money anyway. I am so fucking miserable. I’ve been depressed for about 8-9 years since I was young. My entire teenage life I was depressed. The only thing keeping me happy was this girl and now it’s over and that online life is as well. So I’m stuck being “myself” which doesn’t feel like me and I don’t know what to do. I want to die so badly and I have for so long. I think the only selfless decision I’ve done in the last few years is not kill myself because I know that my dad would be devastated. But I will never be who I want to be and I’m going to live a lie my entire life. I don’t expect sympathy, I just needed somewhere to say this as I’ve never said it before",2.0

She says she has gotten used to it and feels suicidal/depressed for only around 2 days in a month. 

She has tought about cutting herself but hasn't done it since she knows you can get addicted to it. I've tried to convince her to tell her parents or get help but she feels as though it would only cause stress for other people and that she's not worthy of other peoples love.

She's one of the nicest people I've ever met and always looks out for others. She's the last person I'd say has suicidal feelings. I'm not the only one to know about this but no one else has done anything about it.

I've been hiding the fact I'm a non-binary lesbian from my parents for about a year now but things happened about 4 months ago that have me feeling so desperate to get away from home that about a month of it a started cytting. 

2 months ago my parents found out about both things and kicked me out of the house. As I was leaving my dad yelled ""hope you finally kill yourself now""

That just crushed me so badly that I wanted to jump off a tall building, the only reason I didn't is because my dad said he hoped I would. 
For the past two months or so I've been wanting to kill myself and I the temptation keeps getting worse.

I've been living at a friend's house since I can't go home. They know about the sexuality and gender but not the cutting or suicidal mindset. 

I've tied the noose so many times but everytime I'm about to do it the spiteful voice im the back of my head says ""you're only doing what he wants you, proving him right in the process""

I still haven't said anything to my friend and I really don't want to. I know they would get a therapist or something involved and I really don't want that.

For starters, I dropped out of high school and haven’t taken my GED yet. I doubt I’ll pass it because I’m retarded when it comes to everything other than the writing/english portion. I feel like a failure. 

I moved from NYC to FL to be with some asshole guy who manipulates me and makes me feel broken. I want to leave but it’s not that easy for multiple reasons. If I had a car, (don’t even have a license) I’d pack all my shit and just go. I can’t possibly bring all my things and my cat on a plane with me and I really want to take my shit because at this point, I have nothing back at my mom’s place in NY. I gave away/took everything. 

I don’t have a job for a couple reasons I won’t get into. Bottom line is I can’t start working until a couple months from now. And even when I do, I’ll be pissed off because minimum wage here is nearly half of what it was in NYC. And I made way more there because I worked at a high end salon. every product I sold was $50 in cash that day. I had a great job and I fucking quit it for something stupid. 

My mom’s made some stupid mistake that resulted in me losing my insurance that used to cover therapy. I can’t get fucking therapy anymore or anything I need because she did something really really stupid but it’s too much to get into right now. 

I quit my antidepressants cold turkey 5-6 months ago. I don’t know if this is a good thing or a bad thing. 

I used to have an eating disorder. Still fucks with me to this day even though I’m “recovered” and I lost my entire support system. my boyfriend thinks I’m being ridiculous whenever I talk about it. real comforting. 

I’m a girl, I feel like since I’ve been down in the dumps, I haven’t taken care of my appearance at all. I feel ugly. 

My only solace is writing. I’m almost done with a novel that I’ve been relentlessly working on for years. That’s all I have. After that, I don’t know what to do. And since I’ve been so fucking depressed, I can’t make out any good work anymore.

"FrayedI did not want to post this, but I freaked myself out and know I need to talk about this before it manifests into something more extreme.

I have been having suicidal thoughts over the last month.  Mostly minor things I could handle, but today it started feeling serious.  I am generally a happy, fun-loving guy.  However, I feel frayed.  Broken.

Today is my birthday, and so far only my family has wished me a happy B-day.  It sounds lame, but no comments on facebook, no texts from friends.  I have realized I have very few friends.  Looking back, I realize that every group of friends I have ever had has divorced me in some way.  I am the common denominator.  Something is wrong with me.  The cycle is starting to repeat itself.

I see all my old friends and they are doing awesome.  My used-to-be best friend hangs out with his circle...a circle that I started, and no one wants anything to do with me.

I have applied for OCS three times and have been rejected three times.  I applied to law school and just received my rejection letter.  Applying to these things is no easy task.  It took me weeks, months and years to prepare myself.  I feel like I can't win.  I don't bitch to anyone because I want to seem like I have everything together.  It's slipping.  I am afraid I can't handle another rejection.  I keep trying and trying and trying with not so much as a ""nice try"" from anyone.

I can feel myself slipping.  My mind wont shut off and it is overwhelming me.  I am engaged to the love of my life whom I have been dating for over 4 years.  I know I love her...but things are changing in me.  I am so frustrated.  We moved into a new place and I have spent thousands (THOUSANDS!!!!!) in appliances over the last week.  She is beginning to feel distant to me, despite us moving in together.  

I am going bald at 24, losing friends, rejected from everything I worked for.  I am beginning to get bitter and depressed which is expressing itself in anger and this terrible feeling of being frayed.  I am scaring myself.",2.0

"here it comes againYes, I'm being treated. No, I don't have a plan. Chronic, not acute -- yellow alert, not red.

Almost certainly I'll dig myself out of this hole. I'll spend a few months more motionless and wishing I didn't exist, then I'll gradually find some way back towards normality. Then plod through, working and talking, and gradually make up for the time I wasn't there. But before I get close to actually _enjoying_ life, I'll tip back into depression, and go through the cycle all over again.

It's boring, and it's exhausting, and I can't see any way out other than death. I'm 33 now; I've been doing this for almost 20 years. In the past I could (sometimes) believe in the possibility of change. Now I've been round the block enough times that I can't.

My fraternity little brother, who I have been trying to reconnect with after a massive falling out when I got kicked out of the fraternity, has made it clear that my relapse and behavior as a result means he will never speak to me again.

"I wish everything around me would just pauseI dread go to bed at night and waking up knowing I'll continue with this horrible cycle of terrible thoughts. When I was little, it seemed time was moving way too slow. Now it feels like the world is moving way too fast and I cant keep up. Right after I turned 18, I suddenly need to think about so much for the sake of my future. Ive been dealing with suicidal thoughts for 3 years, but I just reached a breaking point recently. I attempted a while back and I failed. It was painful and I guess I felt a slight bit of regret, but there wasn't a clear reason as to why I regretted trying end myself. Maybe it was just survival instincts kicking in and having a lingering effect on me. I still beg for non-existence, but im just too much of a coward to go through with another attempt. I just feel trapped. 

I think my friend found out somehow. I can tell they're uncomfortable talking to me now. I can see them making an effort to talk to me and maybe slip in some words of encouragement about something. Im trying to act normal but I think it's just making them feel a little weirded out and they're not sure what ti say to me. I never wanted them to find out. I feel guilty burdening them with my fucked up self. I wish we never met. Then they wouldn't have to deal with me and they can go on with their life. I am so fucking selfish and I feel so ashamed for feeling suicidal for such stupid reasons.

I never feel like im enough to my parents. I wish they had a different kid. One who could live up to all their expectations. Instead, they got me. I try my best but Im not perfect. I hate failing at things, even the most trivial ones because I know they'll yell at me and I'll be causing them to work even harder than they already do to deal with my failures. I dont deserve to be fed by them and live under their roof. I dont deserve to indulge in my hobbies when I need to focus on my studies. I dont deserve to exist. Im only making them more miserable.

"Confused and feeling alone, just need to get this stuff out of my headFour failed suicide attempts over the past eight months, last attempt was last week and it was the closest I have come to succeeding.
I find I am at a terrifying crossroads right now. I am either about to change my life for good and simply no longer care what people think (an idea that frightens me) or I am going to remain miserable living a life I feel is expected of me because it seems easier in the short term and no one needs to know just how miserable I really am.
I want escape…and the escape is either change my life radically and put up with the scary unknown or take the easy route and just end it all. I don’t want to end it all most of the time, but it seems easier than the healthy alternative when things get too intense.

What exactly is wrong? I am not sure. In love with a guy who can’t be in a relationship as he just got out of a LTR and needs to ‘find himself’ again. I also have feelings for another man who cant do the relationship thing either as it causes him intense anxiety about his own perceived failings and social awkwardness. He likes me but it depressed him to be with me because he does not feel good enough.
I am worthy of something more than both these men can offer, I am worthy of some sort of commitment but the problem is, I see these guys as the only two I am willing to share my true self with. Rationally I know that placing myself on hold for these guys is silly. Rationally I know that there are other guys out there, guys who are just as great, guys I can learn to trust and let myself go with, but…
It is not my rational side that is winning these days.

That said, I am not sure why I care about the school thing. It is mostly my fears of what others will think of me…the degree is not for me, it is more for them…it for me in that I don have to worry about looking like an all out failure in their eyes…

"When the problem is a lack of loveWe've all heard the ""get a therapist"" and ""go with a professional"" thing at least once. We know therapists, psychiatrists, etc, are supposed to help us with whatever is making us feel bad. 

But, guys, let's be honest with ourselves. There are times when no professional, drug, or therapy can solve a problem which origin comes from a lack of love. Of caring. Of tenderness. Of, yes, love. 

It's frustrating for many people to see that what is supposed to help them feel better, what's supposed to help them to overcome pretty dark moments, just doesn't work. And I find it horrible that those professionals aren't honest with their pacients. They keep talking shit, they keep prescribing them drugs, they keep promising a bright future that never comes, etc. But they never say ""hey, I'm sorry, I can't help you with this. There's nothing I can do to fullfill that empty space you've got"". 


So, since they aren't honest, and they won't ever tell you the truth because their opportunity to pay those expensive holidays they want will only exist if you don't find out that they can't help you with your problem; I'm going to tell you what you need to hear:


No therapy, no professional of any kind, no drug of any kind, can replace what you need and you've never had. That thing is love. And it may be hard to hear, I know; but it's the truth. You need to know it. 
And I won't start talking shit about ""there's someone waiting for you out there"", ""you'll find that person, I promise"", because it's the same shit professionals do. 

That's all I have to say.",2.0

"Concerned for my friendThis is my first post on reddit so excuse me if I make any mistakes. My friend is wants to kill himself. He has very explicitly said this. In our most recent conversation he flat out told me he doesn't want to live anymore. He's only 19 and I don't really know what to do or what to say to him. He recently withdrew from his classes at a large University and he won't be able to go back until at least Winter 2016. He thinks that we (all of his friends) hate him and that no one would care if he killed himself, despite me and others telling him we care about him and want to help. He saw a doctor and says he got medication to take but that was three weeks ago and he says they aren't working. So far only me and one other person know about this. I have no idea if I should tell the rest of our friends and I have no idea what to say to him. Should I tell him to try to see another doctor? Therapy? He lives at home with a single mother and they are honestly very poor so I don't really know what his options are.

"Trans girl stuck in a Muslim CountryHi, my name is Aliyah, and I'm transgender MtF. I've lived in Colorado for most of my life, but when I lost my father and was forced to live with my abusive mother I tried to kill myself. Then I moved in with my brother whom I love dearly. The problem is that is very misogynistic and transphobic. He doesn't know that I am trans, but at one point he was frustrated with my sensitive emotions and condescendingly asked my with much anger if I had any balls and if I'd rather be a woman. That was almost a year ago and I'm only 17 and I haven't made any steps towards my transition (like taking hormones or anything). Later in the week I tried to kill myself with more effort. I took a lethal overdose of his anti-depressants (Wellbutrin Bupropion (Not recommended; very scary hallucinations)). I ended up going to a mental hospital again. And now I have to live with my older sister and her husband in Abu Dhabi. I feel so isolated here. I haven't really talked to anyone under 35 for half a year. There's no one to talk to about my problems because if I told my strictly Islamic family I'd probably get killed (&lt;-- exaggeration).

I wish they had another child who was more successful than me so that they could easily forget me. I wish they aborted me at the first sign of my life. But they HAVE to tell me that they love me. Every time they say that, I feel even worse because I'm undeserving of anything. 

I'm happy I don't have any real friends; they would probably keep me in this world, and I would probably keep poisoning their lives with all of my assholish actions and words. I'm probably somehow unconsciously manipulating the people around me; there's no way that anyone would ever want to talk about me.

I can’t look in a mirror without wanting to throw up, I cut and binge until I feel like I’ll throw up then feel bad and do it all over again. 

I’ve tried meds but nothing is working. I told work that I’m getting treatment for depression and I thought my manager understand but today she made it clear to me that she doesn’t. I keep fucking up at my job and I’ve had “talks” about my performance. No matter how hard I try I keep making mistakes like this morning I slept through my alarms (yes multiple) because my meds make me drowsy but if I don’t take them I can’t function durning the day. 

“You can either do this job or you can’t” is what was said to me this morning after I asked for help at work. During this my mother has been fighting advanced cancer and my visa (not in my birth country I have moved overseas) ended causing me a lot of stress. 

I’ve written a note, I keep thinking of how to stop it all and researching how to make sure I do it right. I’m scared to sleep in case I miss work again and get fired because I really think that will be it for me. I’m sorry to bother everyone but I really don’t know what to do.

It feels like my life is a running joke and everyone is laughing behind the scenes waiting for me to finally reach cross the line and end it. My psychosis feels real. Realer than real.

I wish I never existed. I fantasize all the time about dying. Falling asleep and never waking up. Paying someone to shoot me up with a fatal dose of fentanyl. Crashing my car full speed on the highway. Buying a shotgun and blowing the roof of my mouth out. Jumping to my death. Drowning myself with cinderblocks chained to my ankles. Wandering aimlessly into the wilderness at night and starving myself to death.

Therapists haven't worked. Hospitals haven't worked. Meds haven't worked. 9 months of sobriety hasn't worked. I despise waking up every day. I'm ungrateful. I'm majorly depressed. I idealize death.

Having people care about them

Im scared of people like they were carbs

Because i am so mentally in tatters
My tears have burnt the skin under my eyes
It stings.

I cant feel this alone anymore
I cant keep having the only people 
I converse with 
And trust to converse with
Be homeless men with schizophernia 
And criminals who just got out of jail 5 days ago that i meet wandering the streets at 4am
I mean i still will always love and care for those people 
But i want more
I need people who love me 
I need to be busy every single hour of the day laughing 
And sharing 
And feeling safe 
Feeling like im one with the group not one outside of it

"I’m sorryI finally decided I was going to do it last night. I almost did it the night before but my ex checked up on me and called both the police and my best friend so I couldn’t. I lied to the cop and told him I was okay and the cop told my ex. 

My ex then accused me of trying to manipulate him into taking me back and told me he wasn’t going to talk to me anymore. 

I can’t live without him in my life. I made him such a part of me it felt like I was losing everything. 

So I did it. I overdosed last night. But here I am... still alive because I didn’t take enough. I feel so sick and I can’t walk and I just want it all to stop. I went to sleep hoping I wouldn’t wake up. 

I feel like such a bad person. I just want everything to stop. I’m so pathetic and everyone would be better off without me. I know I can do it. I can just take more. But I promised I wouldn’t do it and I feel so guilty that I tried and failed",2.0

"No one would even notice whether I will be goneFuck throwaways. I don't care anymore, since apparently I only matter whenever people want me to do something for them.

I want to die. No one will even notice I'm gone once I pay my dues. Only 3 more months living in this hellhole and slowly cutting ties from everyone I know. Once it's done, I'll just off myself. No more suffering. No more bullshitting my way through the day, no more masking the pain my own existence brings upon me. Nothing will remain and I've never desired anything more than for this shit called life to end.

Nothing brings me joy anymore; my greatest passion is just another thing which shows me how big of a failure I am. All of it is just a goose chase after some abstract goal, which once reached with countless hours of effort, blood, sweat and curses doesn't even feel rewarding. Just another thing off an endless bucket list.

I have no more will to live. I'm lying to everyone around me everyday just to go by, pretending to be someone I never was and never will be. I don't understand how anyone ever could have thought that the piece of trash that I am is worth anything.

Once I'm gone they will know I never was of any value... Can't wait for their realization of this.",2.0

Tired of my own thoughts and my own writing. Praying for death as my saviour. Looking for some relief in one of you feeling pity of me and writing a one-liner of sympathy. Small things can be a major achievement when you’ve been depressed for two years.

"Have depressed feelings and suicidal thoughts.What's up?I am making this post in hope of finding some help..First of all,i am a 16 year old boy who absolutely loves his family,football and until now has has goals for the future and motivation to work hard for them but about a month and a half ago i remembered something bad that i have done.I was about 13 years old i think and a friend of mine,he was a boy aswell,was trying to persuade me into having sex with him.I still don't know what i was thinking and did it.For a few days i think we were having sex and i wasn't realising what i was doing.I continued living my life normally having forgotten about it until about 1 and a half month ago i remembered it and it shocked me.From then until now i have been thinking about my future and how guilty i have been and will feel about it.I can't imagine how my friends and family would react if they knew it.There is no way i will tell them just because it will make them so sad,but on the other hand i cant continue living sharing such a secret with just myself.For a lot of you it may not seem such a big of a deal but trust me for me it is.I wish i could delete it from my memory or even better go back in time and not make that mistake.I just cant stop thinking about it.The other reason which is making me feel soooo horrible are the thoughts that i am having for life in general.I just don't have the motivation to do anything and nothing seems to have a meaning.I imagine myself of going on with my life and doing all the things that are considered fun and exciting but none of it excites me.Note that i have been eating a lot of food and i want to sleep a lot more than before.That is all i wanted to say.Please,i am begging you,if you can help me in some sort of way do it,if you know something that will probably help me please tell me that.I cry everytime i think of the results of my suicide especially in my parents and i don't want to do it but on the other side i just can't keep on living with feelings like this.Anyway,thank you for reading and i am sorry for any mistakes made as English isn't my natural language.",2.0

I've got no real friends, only ones behind a screen. And none of them talk to me at all. I can't go outside because I just have no reason to, there's nothing out there. I've tried to come out of unemployment, because I feel like, if I'm a wagie, then I'd at least be useful to society somewhat. But have you ever tried to write a CV when you have no qualifications and no life experiences? It's impossible. So I just gave up and cried. As I do with anything.

I cant tolerate medication at all, apparently I have a condition that makes stereogenic either ineffective or dangerous. I’ve been on all the pills, and I mean all the pills; no help.  

I lost my career, my job, and most of my money. I will never be able to do anything but work once I am able to get a job, running on a treadmill day after day just to make ends me and never being able to. The system is rigged and mobility is a lie.  

I have no girlfriend. It’s not something I can manage, not since the rape.  

There is not a living person who really cares about me. Not really. I don’t mean much to anyone, I’m just a side character in other people’s lives

I’m never likely going to end it soon. Strangers will probably tell me some empty things like they care about me and to stay strong.  

Nothing is going to turn around without more personal sacrifice and struggle than I have left in me. When I told my therapist that he smiled, and said I was strong. Maybe, but all strength is finite. I’m drowning and the only rope I get are some nice words.  

I need more but there is nothing more for me.  

Life is a sick joke, and then we die. Fuck the system.",2.0

Some people say that it's good to cry and that it relieves them but all it did was give me a headache. In my head I just repeatedly thought about how I can't do it . And by it I mean everything.  All the time lately I've just been feeling like I can't do it . I can't get better. It's pretty much my fault too . I don't have any motivation or desire to get better . If I did I would have put that willpower to good use . I've been trying to get therapy but it's been hard to do exercises or assignments that I've been given for it . I take medication but I don't think it does anything . I'm looking for a larger dose but I don't think that will help either . To truly get better it is gonna take me wanting it . And I just don't want to get better . I plan on killing myself soon . Little bit after I quit therapy . Might run away from my family so nobody around me has to deal with the shame of pushing me to suicide. Sounds hypocritical but I can make me running away sound optimistic if I leave a convincing enough note. I will probably make sure nobody knows when or where I die. Shouldn't be too hard.

It's funny I've spent the last nine months thinking about it and soon it will all be over. I used to have three possibilities that could happen after you die, and now I've narrowed it down to one. People spend their entire lives buried in religious literature, or recycled anti-spiritual secular/humanist ideologies thinking they will find answers there, but they won't.  

Only logic and rational thought can actually guide you in this endeavor. I know what will happen to me when I'm gone, and I know it's better then where I am now, although I've been here before.

"Failing the Bar examAfter my third attempt at taking the bar, if I find that I failed, I'm going to end my life. I'm 300,000 dollars in debt, cannot find a job in the law field to save my life. I'm a doctor of laws and I'm working retail making like 13 bucks an hour. I cant afford to live on my own. I'm a burden on everyone around me. I think I'm mentally and emotionally handicapped, leading to my problems with people. I'm a total asshole, even though I try to be fun and friendly.  My anxiety is so high, I think people hate me, so I end up being a prick. I've never had a romantic relationship longer than 3 months. I haven't had sex with anyone since July of 2015. 
I have had people try to get me in dating apps. I'm on them all. I've had other women approve my profile and told me it all the things I should do to make myself available for others to see me in my best light. I'm too old for someone who isn't as damaged as me. I'm too unattractive to feel wanted. I have swiped right tens of thousands of times, but I'm apparently so offputting that I cant get a match at all. 
I've had depression my whole life. I went to one of the hardest law schools in the country. I've done ""great"" things by most standards. I have lived a good life by most accounts. I cannot be happy as my depression is eating me alive. After failing the bar twice, I was urged to try again. After the heartbreak of failing twice, I see that there is no way out for me. 

If something wonderful doesn't happen by the first week of November,  I will be resigned to my fate. This is probably the only place I will post publicly about it. I want to die. I dont have a reason to live any more. No love, no meaningful relationships, no light at the end of the tunnel. It doesn't get better. It only gets worse. I'll only get older and sadder. I'll only get fatter and balder. I'll only get lonelier and more angry. Better to do this now than to wait until it boils over and I hit someone else. 

I want to do something where no one will ever find my body, like ever. I'm obviously a coward, so how can I do this without getting eaten alive by wolves or drowning painfully? I dont want to traumatize my family or anyone with having to find my gross body. I just want to disappear forever. No body. No burial. I've already thought of the ocean, but I need it to be something that will render my body completely gone with no trace. E.g. I cant use a gun if someone could hear it, or go somewhere in which I could be found.

Judged. 
Mocked and bullied.

All my life I’ve been abused. 

I have this chasm in my chest. 
The pain can be unbearable. 

The mixture of psychotic depression, PTSD and social anxiety is torturous. 

No one understands. 
They all laugh. 

So I cry myself to sleep at night. 
I can’t help but hurt myself and crave to die. 

I’m tired of being told how wrong I am.
That I should just kill myself.
That I am pathetic.. 

The list goes on. 
I’ve done nothing but give to this world. 
And in return of trying to feel free and happy, I get crushed. 
Because I’m different. 

In this world.
You have to be perfect.
If you are slightest bit different to the majority, you get targeted and cast out. 

This is no life for me.
I cannot fit in.
I can never find my peace.
I can never be free of this pain.

In her journal she added a playlist of the music she'd been listening to. I've been listening to it for a while now and the music really resonates with me. It's a really good list. It's a little eerie listening to the music she was listening to just before she died, but I'm feeling it.

To many its seen as selfish but to the one whom experiences the want for it, its because its an escape from , what they feel as, a life time of sorrow. if this was the case, wouldn't it be selfish for the ones around that individual to want him/her to keep going if it is just going to be miserable? I'm not suicidal right now, for the most part, but this idea crosses my mind a lot. any input anyone?",2.0

"Please help me. Talk to me.
There are just too many issues with me to begin the explaining. To put it simply I fucked up my life. I'm a 24 y/o who have been on-and-off attending uni. And still haven't been able to graduate, also doesn't have experience of a proper, long term job. I don't get how it happened. I probably aimed too high and thought too highly of myself (have transfered twice to a higher up uni each time, and I was living alone abroad ) that I'm now having a really hard time accepting the fact I'll have to do things I probably won't like as long as I'm being a productive member of society just like what everybody does. I went to college by the requirement of my family and also cause it's almost a must to my cultural background. But I hate the academic enviroment and tasks so, so, so much. I used to have firm belief that in my field of study/work(art related) it's not a requirment to have a degree, what's valued is your actual skill. But after so many years I've been brain washed into thinking no one will take a second look at my CV simply because I'm not a uni graduate. I dont have any courage and energy left to return to school system at this moment but it feels like I'm loosing something huge. I know I still have some chance to get a job that does not completely waste what I learned but at this low point of mine I'm just too scared and have zero confidence to show my profolio to anyone. I feel like Im losing my mind and I don't know what to do. I think I'll either be killing myself very soon(have been fighting with depression for many years and record of one failed suicide) or in less a year or so. Please help me. Talk to me about anything.

"I hate myself and want to dieI've had inherited depression for my whole life but only recently have I really felt suicidal and I feel like I'm going to do it before Christmas.

I've fucked up my life so bad it would just be easier to kill myself than just wallow in this misery. I'm a relapsed heroin addict that lives with his parents, whom I've also stolen thousands from. Paying them back is the only reason I want to live but I am in so much pain and so ashamed I don't even want to be seen. I also have thousands in debt on 3 credit cards.

My girlfriend that I relapsed with was someone very special to me, I thought I was going to spend the rest of my life with her but she dumped me a week ago because she decided she wants to be single. I told her since we're both trying to quit heroin we could help each other but she wants no part of me. She was the only person I had to talk to, I have no friends besides her anymore.

"I find the biggest reason I remain alive is due to a moral obligation to do so.Hello all.

I post here today not about the reasons for my depression, but instead about the reasons for which I must remain stable. I won't say that I have no other reason to live, because I do. However, the biggest reason I remain alive is because I believe that humans have an intrinsic, inherent moral obligation to stay alive. My friends would be devastated should I die. Several of them are borderline suicidal or are suicidal, and I believe that my own suicide would push more than one of them over the edge. All my life, I have been Mr. Shoulders to my friends, and that's my niche in life. I'm content with that. That's how I want it.

Aside from my friends, I owe society a great debt. Taxpayers have contributed to my education, the roads on which I walk, the food on my plate. I have consumed much of what the general good gives me. I believe it is my moral responsibility to give back to society in the form of economic work until the debt which has been given to me is satisfied.

That is all",2.0

Currently, there are 5 crisis/suicide hotline call centers through the US who have added crisischat into their facilities and more coming online soon.  All of the volunteers working on crisischat go through the same training as phone counselors, and then some. I worked as a crisis phone counselor for over a year before I trained for crisischat and I've been working here for over a year.  

It is completely confidential and there is no way we could track you down through your computer -this is a common misconception.



Things you should know before you log on: 

1) This is a very new movement and is functioning well above capacity. Since counselors are only on one chat at a time, people often have to try back later. Please don't be discouraged! Try back later, or if you need to talk to someone right then you can call the national suicide hotline at 1-800-273-TALK. 

2) When you log on and talk to a counselor, they are devoting their entire attention to you! Counselors are only on one chat at a time and there are always people we are unable to help due to capacity issues, so please no multitasking! 

3) Using cellphones, Ipads, etc often leads to connection issues. If possible, please use a laptop or computer.

After 2 years i've finally managed to get out with my crush we have been for over 4 months almost 5 already, what i didn't know was that she was suicidal, just because of me... i went to her place had a cute time hugging each other and that but she went to the bathroom i realized that her diary was on the desk i couldn't help myself i had to take it with me, and i rode it all....

&amp;#x200B;

learnt out she had been suffering to be with me for also some years, she really liked me and didn't want to lose me on the last pages i rode that she was that kind of person that gets tired of others fast even if she doesn't want to and some pages where you cant even see whats written because they're full of tears except some things that i could read were:

&amp;#x200B;

can't image not being with him , we probably wont last long because i know myself i will get tired of him and suffer even more than these years of wanting to be with him, nothing makes sense anymore i should't even be here...

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

she didn't realize i rode it all since i took it and brought it back the next day,

&amp;#x200B;

now everything makes sense she's been really sad lately can't even hug her im really worried and she doesn't admit she's sad, she is all i basically have , the only thing that wants me to wake up every morning call her talk with her, be with her

&amp;#x200B;

i guess this will all take an end the only person ive truly loved, im just constantly thinking of her crying 24/7 when im home or just alone i dont want to end this but its coming closer everyday the only person i can truly tell the truth to, someone im not scared of talking to asking for help anything this is just coming to an end and there is no need for me anymore just cant take it anymore",2.0

I don't feel any desire to connect with other people anymore. I don't find hobbies enjoyable anymore. I'm no longer motivated by my career. I had so many goals not too long ago and now I just watch Netflix and pray I die overnight.

This is stuck in skin, bones, and muscle. People will bring up plastic surgery, but the technology just isn't there in 2018 to make an significant differences to actually ugly people. It will help, but it won't be enough. Many people will jump on the ""technology is improving"" bandwagon which also is a load of nonsense since medical technology advancement is measured in decades, not years.

"You go to someone when you're really down, and they kick you into the depths of oblivionI haven't slept in 2 days. I haven't slept in 2 days, my throat feels like it's on fire, and I'm panicking. I'm panicking like a madman. I lay in bed for boundless periods of time and I can't sleep, and I feel like there's something crawling at my throat, and I feel absolutely miserable in every sense of the word. I feel like I don't have legs, I feel like I can't think or talk correctly. I feel like a broken 20 year old.

Then I tell my parents, and suddenely everything gets emotionally worse from 30 different angles. ""You're so ungrateful. Everyone has to go through what you're going through. I've already taken you to enough doctors. I know EXACTLY what you're feeling, and the way to make them better is with these here vitamins."" Vitamins. I must've heard that word, or a euphemism like that a million times in the last 2 hours. The same vitamins I've taken for a million months, which he accuses me of not taking and not doing. 

""You're only 20, and I'm 60, so obviously I have much better life experience and know what you're feeling."" 

""You don't need antidepressants. They're pointless.""

After being up for days: ""Look, why don't you just stay up all day and sleep tonight. It shouldn't be that hard. Just do it."" Saying the same things for different days. 

And I'm sorry, and I know you love me, and I'm sorry. But try to listen to me for once.

Then I storm out of the room. Taking xanax I have, trying to fall aseleep. He wakes me up 30 minutes later to show me a video on all the healing power of the vitamins. And I can't think.

And then a bigger argument erupts. And now I feel so terrible and guilty and atrocious. I'm a failure as a son. I'm a fucking failure as a human being. I'm so sorry you had to read this shit. It's from an annoying life that was better off not there in the first place.

"Please helpHello, I'm posting this on behalf of a loved one (my girlfriend). I am in my late teens and she is in her early twenties.

 She has an incurable condition which causes her constant chronic pain and in many respects makes her life crap. She is also extremely depressed and will talk about suicide with me quite openly. She quite often expresses the desire to jump off a cliff or purchase a firearm and shoot herself with it (I live in the UK so this would be pretty hard). She hasn't made any attempts recently but I know that she has jumped off of a building before and that she has tried overdosing on codeine painkillers on more than one occasion. She says that she doesn't want to live (even if her disease is cured) because the part of her that cared about living died a long time ago. She says that she is trying to think of a method of killing herself that will be 100% effective that will leave no chance of her becoming a vegetable on life support for the rest of her life. I have tried numerous times to get her some help be it from therapy or anti-depressants but she has none of it.

After 2-3 years of this I reached my wits end today and told her sister and father all about it because I genuinely feared for her life. I know I did the right thing and hope that they can get her some help but she seems so far gone to me. She also found out about me telling and said that she can never trust me with anything again and for a moment wanted to never speak with me again. I'm really tired and emotionally drained and just need some help here. What am I supposed to do?",2.0

"suicidal long distance partnermy boyfriend lives in the north of england and i live in the south. he's a brilliant person and i genuinely love him. he has a great sense of humour, outward confidence, he's doing great with his studies and has landed some part time jobs too, i'm really proud of him.

&amp;#x200B;

unfortunately, he has been raped and systematically abused as a child, he's killed someone, and he doesn't know how to accept love. he attempted suicide once before, and nowadays he uses alcohol, cigs, cocaine, mdma, weed and whatever else he can get his hands on to cope, but he still lapses into these dark weeks. he says he feels  ready to kill himself, he's written a letter, and recently he's started cutting himself too though i don't know how badly. every time he goes into a dark time i feel i get closer and closer to losing him. i am also suicidal for my own reasons, if he goes i'm going to give up too. he knows this.

&amp;#x200B;

i've got the direct emergency number for his town's services and he's promised to call to say goodbye if he does anything. i'm so worried, it's eating me up and i don't know how to talk to him about it. he won't talk about things with me. i don't know what to do. if anyone can help me i would be really grateful

"At this point I am absolutely certain that I will never be free of depression. Why keep living?It's been more than five years since I accepted that I was depressed and tried to get help. A few months ago I stopped seeing my psychiatrist and therapist. Almost five years of nonstop medication with precisely no success whatsoever, and four years of going through over a dozen therapists and never feeling like a single one of them actually knew how to help me, if they even cared at all. I thought that I'd eventually just get used to it, but I never did. Every day is somehow more miserable than the last.

Nobody would miss me at this point. I haven't had any friends in three years, and my family stopped talking to me after I moved out. They were never shy about expressing their great disappointment in me, anyway. Cutting them out of my life was for the better. I've never had a relationship and certainly never will. The only people in the entire world who would even notice I had disappeared would be my boss and my landlord.

The only advice I've ever seen is to believe that my depression will be lifted someday. I can't believe that. I literally have no hope in it anymore. So what I ask is this: assuming that I will be depressed for the rest of my life, why shouldn't I just kill myself now?",2.0

I know I’m too much of a wuss to follow through. But I don’t want to be here. I feel fucked up beyond repair. These men have taken everything from me, violated me, taken away my ability to live a normal life. Marred my childhood with filth. Made me dirty. 

I want to write to everyone I care about, tell them how sorry I am, how much I appreciate them. Just so they know, just in case. Just to see if anyone sees how much I’m suffering.

I used to dream about wanting to be happy and fulfilled with my life.

I don’t have the capability nor the intelligence to help others. The only thing I have is loneliness, misery, and overall incompetence at everything in life.

My only option is suicide. All of these dreams I once had are nothing but a fantasy land. The only plausible reality is me dying at 19 years old. The world will be better off without me once I am dead.

"Success/money/relationships aren't the cureI see a lot of posts about people, mostly young individuals, being unhappy with their lives and thinking that they would not be depressed if they had money, or were better looking and found an attractive partner, or were 'successful'. I used to think the same a couple of years ago. But then I achieved most of those things. 

 My family went from being poor to attaining a decent amount of wealth. I was a failing student but pushed myself and was able to improve my grades and attend a good university. I started working out a lot and am became more 'attractive'. I have the opportunity to marry an amazing person.

 But I'm not happy at all. Actually I feel even worse now because I realize all those things were an illusion and there really is no cure. I was suicidal before, and I'm more suicidal now. The dark feelings just manifest themselves differently. People say 'things get better', and that may be true, but 'things' aren't the problem in the first place. Some of us are just broken individuals, and we will struggle until the day we die, no matter what. 

 I have people who care about me and that is what forces me to keep going. It feels like blackmail. 'Don't try to escape the pain, otherwise, your loved ones will be hurt beyond words!'  I pray every night that I don't wake up, I hope the universe listens someday soon.",2.0

Shitty and falling apart. Alot like my life. Only reason we had it was because my mom was dating some complete asshole who had a house.

 Even though the rest of my family is fairly attractive I just got beat with the ugly stick.

"I'm over 18, but have to stay with abusive parents until I finsih high school. What can I do? I can't deal with this anymore.I recently turned 18 and I'm in the second last year of school (high school lasts 13 years in Germany), so I will graduate next spring. Since school is pretty hard at the moment (I usually have school from 8 until 5 o'clock), I can't get a job without abandoning my education and I do have to study a lot. School is even harder since I have a very troubled family. My parents recently divorced, since my father was very abusive towards me and my sister. Yet the situation got even worse. My mother never gave a fuck about my dad punching and kicking me and my sister and is the most bitter person I know. She drags me down daily, telling me how fucking worthless I am. She is probably on the verge of turning schizophrenic, she literally walks around the house and screams how stupid and worthless I am and how I will fail in life... It's hard to find words to describe this, but I am breaking down completely. My sister is also really fucked up, she has borderline and is very cold and manipulative, like my mother. I develeoped an eating disorder in order to deal with the pain and when my family found out, they simply laughed in my face, instead of offering me help or being concerned. This situation is fucking my life up in so many ways, I probably devreloped a social anxiety as well, since I can't interact with people the way I want to. School is horrible, people probably think I don't like them since I can't make myself talk to anyone, I have no real friends and I almost dropped out of shcool last year. My life is an an absolute mess. I don't know what to do. I can't live with my father and my other relatives would never believe me, since my mother already sent me to a psychiatric ward and made them belive I am crazy a while ago. They are very, very narrow minded people...  Because my mother didn't work for a  long time and did a bad job during the divorce, my father gets to keep most of the money. We don't have a car, I don't even have a fucking bike anymore. My mum gives me shit when I ask for money for school books, food or clothes. I'm trying to pay as much by myself as I can, but my financial resources are very limited as you can imagine.

What is it that is keeping me alive, what is it that is making me come to this subreddit and post? I dont know! Some inherent strive to stay alive? 

I had my plan all set for tonight. Straight up suffocation by pulling a cable tie as hard as I could around my neck. I suppose the fact that I would struggle for breath terrified me a bit, but I had no other means. I felt a peace today as I knew (thought I knew) that I would be ending my life and not having to deal with it anymore. Yet when I printed my note out and was on my knees with the cable tie around my neck, not having pulled it yet, I was so hesitant. My family would be hurt, my friends even, but I know eventually they would get over it. Why should I have to be such a burden on them for much longer? 

I've been struggling with depression for 5 years now, 22 year old male. With two other attempts under my belt, I told myself that I would be successful with the third. So far I'm not, but I can still change that. I lost a good job a couple weeks ago and broke up with my girlfriend yesterday. Its hard to see any bright future out there, hold on to any possible hope that would help me. It looks to just be a continual cycle of pain and suffering.

I've told my mom about this a lot and when I told her again last night she just said not this again. When I told my dad he just saw said forget about what happened and get confidence (just get it out of thin air I guess) I've seen a therapist yet for about a year yet it it didn't help whatsoever. I mainly can't go back seeing one because they're all an hour+ away and my parents won't drive me that far. I'm at my wits end and just want to end it all I'm so fucking tired.,2.0

"Last resort.To start this I know my depression has taken over completely. I only fell into my depression about a year ago when 3 big part of my life broke in front of me.

I am a 19(M) and I have had the worst of years ever couldn’t tell you when I was last happy until yesterday, me and my friend’s decided to go camping and drinking. It was one of the best experience in my life but the second I got home it felt like a baseball bat hit me in the face, I couldn’t think and I just fell into a panic attack. I went to my bedroom and I couldn’t move out of my bed.

I have tried most things that doctor’s have recommended but it just doesn’t work. I just finished writing my suicide letter to my dad, mom, sister, all of my 4 under 10 year old siblings. I only make every thing harder for my family. Like I said this is my last resort. I don’t know what to do. I am the problem and my family shouldn’t have to suffer because I can’t beat my depression.

"Physical abuse wise my dad had beat me several times, I never really understood that it was abuse until not that long ago, things like hitting my legs together what seemed like as hard as he could, hitting me on the face as hard as he could, threatening to choke me out, etc. it overall made me feel pretty disassociated, I just didn't really understand why though, my relationship with my parents became this extremely hollow thing that felt like an obligation rather than having genuine parents. as I got older from 10 on they became increasingly mentally abusive on top of it, at age 11 my dad found out that I'm trans by looking on my computer and screamed at me for an hour and threatened to hospitalize me (He didnt know mental hospitals wont hospitalize people for it, and might've ended up trying to put me into conversion therapy or something) this is around where my mental health completely snapped, going into 7th grade, hitting age 12, I started becoming extremely suicidal, I thought about hanging myself at school or stabbing myself, it became too much to bear, not being able to be openly trans, being beaten, feeling on edge non stop, feeling completely invalidated to the core of who I am as a person.

Working a at a dead end job with more than half my paycheck going to bills then the rest needs to be saved up for gas to go to work. One of my relatives opened up about 4-5 credit cards under my name and racked up a couple thousand dollars worth of debt. I don't even know where the cards are at..

"Thoughts about suicide became everyday routineThis is happening during last 3 years. It started pretty weak, I thought about suicide once in a month, but then it became worse and worse. I already had 4 real suicide attempts which ended up in reanimation. Actual planning of suicide and not such successful attempts were way more than 4. 

Today thoughts about suicide became my everyday routine before I go to sleep. Sometimes this is the only thing that can make me fall asleep - knowing that one day I will finally die and this all will end. It make me feel calm. I know this is sick. I never wanted my life to be this way. But this is how it is. 

One thing that I wish more than anything is that one lucky day I will have real opportunity to do it. When I'll be all alone and I'll be in right mood. I'll drink some alcohol and hang myself.

"Shit sucksI really can’t remember a time in my life where I was depressed. I acknowledged the possibility of suicide at age 6 when the person who sexually abused me mentioned that he could end my life with some incredibly easy to obtain items. I’ve struggled with the idea since. 
My entire childhood was abusive, as an adolescent my father died from an OD, mother was addicted to pills and just wasn’t there, the city I grew up in was rough to say the least. 
Around age 11 I started doing risky shit I won’t mention specifically here with the hope that I wouldn’t wake up, by age 13 I was doing those things literally every night with the same hope. Along the way I am positive I have caused some brain damage as I am just 300% dumber than I was. 
Went from that star student with every college on deck to a 5th year college senior who is on a “break” and has been for a year. Don’t think I’ll ever be able to handle going back but I really really want to. 
Had a miscarriage two days before Christmas. I wanted that baby more than anything I could even try to imagine and it was just ripped from me. Unsure if I’ll ever be able to carry a baby to term now. 
I haven’t been to work since June. Got hurt at work and need surgery before I can return. I am in constant pain and the doctors are taking fucking forever to get everything sorted out. I do nothing all day long. Can’t even clean the house because I am either too depressed or too lazy and I can’t really figure out which. 
I have lost literally every friend I’ve ever had. For a long time I did that shit where i blamed everyone else but today, after being ghosted by the fourth person in the last 6 days, I realized that I am the fucking problem. 

I have always wanted to die but I have also always seen SOME type of “light” at the end. I see nothing now. I am 23 years old and I am struggling not to self harm like I’m fucking 12 years old. I am pathetic and I don’t think I have ever wanted to die as badly as I do right now.",2.0

"Being alive is my biggest mistake. Since the mid 90's I found myself toying with the idea of killing myself. I used to think that if I just took it easy and pressed forward things would get better and these feelings would pass. Since things are far worse now and have caused me to become even more mentally ill I've decided to kill myself. I think the main reason I want to die is human nature. I hate being around people and there is no way to get out of the rut I'm in without being around someone. I don't even know how to talk to people anymore. I find having a conversation with people to be painful. Other than that I was severed with an eviction notice last month. I have to move out by tomorrow. I don't have any family left so I'll be out on the street in a world I deeply hate full of people I can't stand to be around. I believe that I was put in the wrong place. I do not have the ability to connect with others and find their emotions and needs to be unreasonable. It's not like I'm special anyway. There's 7 billion people on this planet. I can be easily replaced by someone who will connect with others and contribute to society instead of just be a drain on it. It's illogical for me to stay alive.

"Can never be happy because I'm inferior to everyone else. What's the point in even living?I'm 29 and I've suffered from really bad social anxiety and associated depression since I was 18. Suicidal thoughts are starting to get a hold of me.

My main problem in life is that I compare myself negatively with everyone, and everyone is better than me. I can't live up to what I should be and I feel like an inferior person.

I only have 1 or 2 friends and they are more drinking buddies than friends. This contrasts with the majority of people who have at least 5 close friends.

I've only had sex with two people. This compares negatively with most twentysomethings who go through at least one wild hookup phase in life. Casual sex and one night stands are glorified and idealized because they are exciting, but I'm too useless to have ever gone through a phase like that. 

I have worked from home doing freelance work since I was 25. I only worked in an office for 12 months of my life back in 2014. This contrasts with most people who spend their twenties befriending coworkers, practising their social skills in office environments, and generally being around people. 

Because of my work, I've done quite a lot of travelling. I lived in thailand for 6 months in 2016, 2017, and 2019. I've visited Berlin, Budapest, and Saigon during that period too. However, the vast majority of people in solo travel siutations like that would've made lots of friends. I probably interacted with other people and went out drinking maybe 15-25 times during all of that travel; |I was mostly isolated as fuck.

The reason suicidal thoughts have taken a hold is that I can't even make up for any of this stuff now. I have a six-month old daughter and like a selfish prick, I feel trapped and consigned to a life of the struggles of parenthood without any hope of meeting a new friend or becoming more sociable ever again.

The level of guilt you feel from resenting your own child's impact on your life is enormous, and I can't cope anymore. Is there ever a hope of making up for missed fun during my 20s? Am I being unrealistic in my appriasal of other peoples' happy lives?",2.0

I get so tired from the smallest things. I worry about everything. I am so depressed. I know people say that it's just teen angst, but I know it's something more. I never sleep. I stay up hours every night crying or just lying there, staring at the ceiling. Nothing helps.  

I am not happy like my peers. I try to act happy but it's all fake. Even if I feel happy on the surface, deep down it hurts.

I have incredibly loving friends and a boyfriend who is just awesome. He is so supportive and loving and I don't know what I would do without his sfriendship. That sounds unhealthy, but we've been friends since middle school and even if we weren't dating we'd still be best friends.  These are the only reasons I'm still here, because suicide would be too selfish. It would hurt them.


But I am starting to think that I will always be this way, since so many people have a lifetime of depression. I need to know there's a cure, a way to get rid of it. If this is how I'll always be, I don't want to exist. It's just not worth the effort.",2.0

You may say I have a whole life ahead of me, that may be true, a life full of depression and failure, one where everyone hates me.

I have nothing to offer, I am as my aunt said “a waste”

So for those reasons, it’s time for me to go. It’s been a nice experience here on this fucked up and cruel world, but my time is over. I’ve tried everything, losing weight - failure, driving - failure, grades - failure. Meanwhile, everyone around me is accomplishing what I fail to do.

I hate myself. I have no friends, none. I could die and no one would come to my funeral except my siblings. Our mom died 2 years ago and I really miss her. She’s was the only one who ever believed in me, loved me deeply, and supported me. She was my best friend. She never said but I think she knew. The way she would always point things out “Isn’t that sweet” referring to a lesbian couple shopping together. I always rolled my eyes and never saw what she was getting at. I didn’t know until a few months ago. I finally realized she was telling me it was ok. I’m still confused and I don’t know what to do. My family is homophobic and would never understand. I know they love me but they would never understand. I didn’t really believe in a god, but I thought, maybe if I was really good in my life there was a way I could see her again. So, I got super religious and turned to the lord. I didn’t feel like I was living my truth and stopped, religion is just not for me. I’ve been trying to hold on even after. My whole life has been me just hanging in there, waiting for it to get better. It hasn’t. I try for my mom because I know she would be proud of how far I have come, but I can’t. 

Sorry for the poorly writing story I’m fighting back tears. I really don’t know what to do. I’m depressed and I can’t take the struggle anymore. My siblings have given me a lot already and I don’t want to ask for more. What now?

"I've reached my limitHi there,

I've been great for a couple of months I felt good about myself but this week I've been reaching my limit I've had my finals for my night school been working for 3 years to get my education over with I've failed a couple of exams and work is not going well no matter how hard I tried, I work as a repair technician mostly I devices and laptops and such I'm also a sales person at my job but I can't seem to repair or sell anything it's been almost 2 months that I've been failing at doing my job correctly

I'm tiered of failing at everything I do I'm not stupid or anything I learn from my mistakes still shit goes worng I don't believe in any kind of God but if he exists he is makingy life a living hell I know it sounds super dumb that I'm so worked up about school and work not going well but I can't help it i always give 100% yet I'm failing at everything single thing I do, I feel sick I feel worthless, the only reason I'm not dead yet is because I have a loving family, and great friends, I really don't know what to do i wanna end it but then all my friends and family will be sad, I don't wanna go to a stupid psychiatrist they don't help in my opinion I've been at this point before went to one she only made it worse, possibly she was not great at here job but still, the only one who can make you feel better is yourself, but i don't know if i can get over this it's to fucked up in my head right now i just wanna stop exciting, others will be sad but I will finally get some peace in my head notting to worry about nobody to please or satisfie, no.

"I was not suicidal.Me. 

I was not suicidal. I did not have a desire to die. I was just apathetic towards being alive. I did not feel a proper connection with anyone. I did not feel like anyone truly understood me. I personally was at fault for many of my failed relationships with other people. I thrived off energetic and close relationships. I needed other people, but I wanted to be needed. I thought I had reached out for help or reached out to fix things. I felt like I never received a proper reciprocal response from other people. I do not know whether I misinterpreted their actions or lack thereof, but understanding other people’s emotions and intentions when directed towards me is something I was never able to properly grasp. I was terrible at consistency: academically, emotionally, mentally, and socially. I possessed the level of maturity to know my faults, but also a level of immaturity to not care; or an inability to overcome the mental hurdle. I made lots of mistakes in my approach to situations and felt like I passed too many opportunities to properly fix my past and set myself up for a better future. I do not blame any person or group for how I felt. I blame myself. I was mentally unfit. I was sick. No one noticed. 



Others.

I had such little hope for society, or the world. Science, medicine, exploration, discovery, and human love all have unlimited depths and together make up the entirety of what is important, yet very few people cared. People are so focused on the pettiest aspects of their lives. Religion, politics, social media, general hatred and ignorance, are used in so many heart-breaking ways. Humans have such amazing potential, if people could work as one. Humans are approaching the Great Filter, and they will not pass through. The world was lonely enough without anyone reaching out to me, but watching people not reach out to each other was worse. Humans are amazing animals with the incredible intelligence that would have allowed them to extend influence across space, time, and truly the universe itself; they are just too simple minded to realize proper cooperation. Some do, but most are focused on how to divide and put down rather than unite and achieve. Throughout the past the small percentage of future focused individuals could make up for the short comings of everyone else, and their advancements and technology are truly impressive. The challenges coming may not all be soon, but preparation for them is, and people need to be preparing together. People do not achieve great things individually. Only with cooperation. They do not understand.

"I have suicidal thoughts everyday and I self harm.Basically, the only reason I'm alive is because I don't want to be a even bigger burden to my family. I don't want one of my siblings to have to find my body and I don't want them to waste money while it's already tight on a funeral. Yet I'm a burden just by being alive and I'm starting to get desensitized. 

The only time I don't feel suicidal is when I cut myself. The pain is the only thing that distracts me from my suicidal thoughts. Everything I once enjoyed feels meaningless. 

I already have a plan on how I'm going to do it. I've researched so many times I'm well aware of what will happen during and after the process. I know it's not healthy and I know I'm horrible. 

My parents won't take me seriously when I say how I'm feeling and I know if I don't get help now it'll be too late.

"Non-visible handicapsI have a non-visible handicap which prevents me from having real relationships with people (no it's not autism, I've asked my psychologist, but I have a real diagnosis). I always felt ashamed of it, I don't even dare name it here because I fear the reactions people will have to it. I can connect to no one, every friendship I've ever had, every nice person I've ever encountered, it can all just melt away in an instant. I got a depression last year and I am still struggling with it, even though I take my meds consistently. I want to die almost every night. As soon as my brain gets the chance to analyse anything, I get suicidal and think about how pointless it is that I have kept living all this time. I don't dare name my handicap because it's so misunderstood and some even call it a gift. But let me tell you, having to live with it is a fucking nightmare. Today I lied to my roommates about where I was, since you can't really say ""Yeah, just looking for a good spot to tie a rope to a tree."" I am so ashamed of what I am, I have to hide myself constantly and will never be able to find another person who can truly understand me. I have maybe two real friends, my parents only ever wanted me to do well in school and couldn't give a fuck about anything else.

had to talk my friend down tonightso to celebrate my bday i had a small party with like 8 friends and my best friend got drunk off some cheap wine and got really upset and started talking about how she wanted to be dead and that it’d be better if she wasn’t around etc. it was really scary to hear because i was drunk as well and i didn’t want to fuck it up and say the wrong thing but it made me realize that how much she had been there for me and i was being incredibly selfish not thinking she could be feeling the same way i did. it’s hard to remember that we are not the only people in the world and that hundreds and thousands of people exist outside of our own little bubble and we never know exactly what’s happening to them.,2.0

See, in a past relationship, I was raped every night for six months. On top of that, When I was a child, my mother died and my father couldn't handle it. I looked too much like her and it would always send him over the edge. I've been beaten, stabbed, chased with chain saws and shot at. Needless to say, Whenever, I fall asleep, I have the most horribly vivid nightmares. Everything that's ever happened to me, just plays on repeat all night. I need to have someone there, so when I wake up, it helps me to remember where I am and that I'm safe. I can't fall asleep without someone. I'm literally, terrified of sleeping. My SO just doesn't care. He sees it as burden on him. He wants to be able to go out and live his life, which, I get. People need to be able to have their own time, but I want to be able to sleep. Idk how much longer I can keep going like this. Everyday, I feel like I'm wading through mud. My body aches and I'm getting more and more depressed. I've started thinking of insane ideas to get sleep, ranging from hiring cuddlers on craigslist to overdosing on sleeping pills. Although, I know I'll, probably, never do any of them, cause I'm too much of a wuss. I'll most likely just stay up all night and cry... again. ",2.0

"Im not saying I will, but I'm not saying I won'tThe past 10 years of my life have had lots of ups and downs. Ive suffered with depression for the entire decade practically and just cant see much of a reality of escaping it. 

On NYE, I told myself that I'm going to make it through. 2020 will be the start of something good, it'll be the light I need. But I told myself that last year and last year did have a few defining moments that made it seem that everything was coming up for Nat. Yet here I am. I should have been half way through my first year of uni by now, but that dream was snatched away just 2 weeks before I was supposed to start my degree.  And if it wasn't for dreaming  that a degree would give me a better future, I'd still be in a job right now. Yet here I am. 

Ive been unemployed for 4 months now. Struggling to find a job and still not knowing what I really want to do with my life. Im sick of everyone telling me something will come along soon. I can't stand having to ask my parents for financial help because even they aren't in the best position right now. 

How can I keep telling myself that it's going to get better, when it never does? I don't want to have to lie. 

Im sat here sobbing because I just feel so fucking lost and I can't trust myself. I make promises that I won't hurt myself, and truth is I don't want my actions to hurt the people that mean the most to me.

But the hard truth is I'm not sure I can keep up with this. The thoughts always come flooding back.

I fantasise about death. I dream about how I would die, and I enjoy it. I imagine the feel of it and the feel of my life slipping away.

"I dont want to become an adult.I'm currently 16, struggling with suicidal thoughts for almost two years now. I know I wont be able to deal with the responsibilities of being an adult. The world scares me, I'm scared of everyone and everything, only feeling happy when I'm not awake and just sleeping. That's why I try to either work myself into exhaustion by drawing the entire day, doing piece after piece, or sleeping for hours even when I'm not tired, it's when I dont have to worry about anything and can just not exist. That's why I planned a way out before turning 18, faking sleep problems so I can get sleeping pills to take enough to not wake back up.

"I just can't do it anymore. It hurts so much, I hate myself so much.I just want to die. So badly. I'm pathetic. I'm fat and ugly and covered in scars and just all around an awful example of a human being. I don't have any friends in real life anymore, since I left school they've barely talked to me. I frustrate and anger my parents more and more lately. They used to yell at me occasionally but now it's pretty much every day. My brother used to look up to me, but now I'm just a disappointment. I haven't done schoolwork in so long, my entire 11th grade year was just me rotting in my room. I used to be smart too, straight As in a top school, but now I can barely do anything. Fuck. I've done so many horrible things to the people around me. I'm a disgusting excuse for a human being. 

There's no point at all. I don't want to live anymore. I hate everything about myself and my life. I wish I could start over as someone completely different. It hurts to be alive. Physically and mentally and emotionally. I'm on meds. I have been for over a year. My therapist quit in June, and I won't have a new one til October. I don't even know why I'm posting here. If any of you actually knew me, you'd agree about how much of a waste of space I am. I just. Can't. Not anymore. I hate myself so much. I always have. I remember hating myself at age 7, because I was too fat. One of my earliest memories is being called piggy by my cousin. 

God, just, what do I do? All 17 years of my life have been full of mental illness and me being a burden on the people around me. If it weren't for my parents being crushed, I would have killed myself a long time ago. But they're angry at me all the time now, I know it would be better if I had never existed. I wish I was dead.

"Finally leaving r/SuicideWatchFor the longest time, I had been ridiculously unhappy with my life. I knew the moment I hit rock bottom was the day I woke up and just...didn't feel happy anymore. It was such a foreign feeling, like I had just lost the feeling of being alive 

I thought that feeling would never go away, or that I was exaggerating, because I had been through much worse before this. It just seemed like everything was going wrong at the same time, and life would never be joyous again. 

I had my entire plan written out and ready to go. My note underwent countless revisions and reworkings, because I didn't want anyone to think it was their fault. I even gave myself a deadline.

I said, if things didn't work out by my 18th birthday, I'm killing myself. 

I'm not 18 yet, still have a few months to go, but I can now say with certainty that those days are over for me. I don't know what happened. I didn't even realize it happened. I just woke up again one morning and thought, *I don't mind being alive*.

I used to frequent here a lot on another account, but over the months I've slowly just...stopped coming, yet never officially separated myself from this subreddit. 

But now, it's time. This is my official withdrawing from r/SuicideWatch. Not because I'm ending my life tonight, but because I'm starting it again.

I'm glad I no longer feel this way. I'm glad I no longer feel the need to come here anymore. I'm glad that I can feel happy again.

Suicide is courage  
Fuck what you think

That life’s worth living  
  

It’s a knife in the back  
To the ones you love  
Fuck the ones that don’t  
And the ones who won’t  
  
  
When they hear your name  
On the local news  
“They died in pain”  
I take their abuse  
  
  
“How could they?”  
“How would they?”  
They scream and scream  
And scream but nothing

The water looked nice  
From up high  
Like a doorway  
A sure way  
To the Nevermore  
  
  
No one asks if I’m okay  
No one begs me to stay  
They wish me away  
They wish I were dead  
I leave them afraid  
To hide under their beds  
Til that fateful day  
Til their day of death  
  
  
“How does one die?”  
I asked the water  
“Is it as easy as  
A step forward?”  
  
  
“No,” says the water   
“It takes a millennia of lives   
For your shift to be over,  
For the night to be colder,  
  
  
For Death to die.  
  
  
But it takes only a day  
To stop having a say  
To follow the Way  
And grow a day older.”

"So I've recently started having anxiety attacks where it becomes hard to breathe, with the subject regarding many topics, mainly obsessing about relationships and government bureaucracies that I have to handle lately, and mainly where my life is going. I feel kind of lost. My spouse and I live in a war-torn country full of people trying to rip you off any chance they get, everyone is rude and generally don't fit the way I've been brought up, everything is expensive and the stress is beyond measure here. Not how we were brought up. We're waiting for me and her to finish college so we can get out of here and move to a civilized nation elsewhere.",1.0
"Everything's terrible, Utterly alone, Nothing to really live for, Anyone care to talk for a few?I don't really know what to put, I've never reached out to anyone before, but I have no other options, and I've actually talked to people on reddit that were a lot... better? then people I personally know, so I'm hoping someone is reading this.

I'm at the point of totally giving up, I just really need someone to talk to, even my local crisis center hung up on me...

I don't feel like explaining my whole life story, but pretty much:

in 2010...
-Over weight all my life, heaviest weight was 490lbs when I graduated from high school.
-Never tried to develop social skills as a child, took whatever friends I could get, no relationships, all due to self esteem issues and a sheltered upraising from my parents.
-After leaving highschool, fell into a world of drugs which led to an overdose, which left severe liver and kidney damage.
-Lost my Job, have been unable to find employment since then.
End of 2012.
-Now weigh 178lbs, Look totally different and know one remembers me. When they ask how I lose it, I have to give them some lame excuse instead of saying hard drugs and an overdose will do that.
-Anything I found joyous and fun is now bland and boring.
-On multiple medications for pain and mood issues.

I've actually overdosed again on Gabapentin four nights ago when the girl that I ever came closest to loving told me to ""Fuck off and never talk to her again"" and then proceeds to hook up with some other guy who was using me this whole time... Anyways, I woke up a couple hours covered in puke and blood and extremely confused. I cleaned myself up and acted like nothing happened...

If anyone cares, I'll tell them more. I really need someone to talk to, my grip on life is slowly loosening and I'm really not attempting to hold on..",2.0

"I don’t want to live and cause everyone else more heartache. I want to die and make everyone happy.It’s 1:21 AM. And I have made my decision. Not today, not tomorrow, not next week, but some day, I am going to end my life. 

I am so tired of ruining everyone’s lives. I’m so tired of feeling trapped. I can’t get out of my own head and I can’t escape from my own reign of terror.

I have anger problems. I ruin everything because of it. Everyone thinks I’m crazy, and maybe they’re right. 

I can’t escape from my own thoughts. I can’t escape from the anxiety that runs my life. I can’t escape from the ridicule of everyone else. I can’t escape from being on a road to nowhere. I’m never going to be anything in life, so why live it? Why be here?

Sure, my parents would be sad. But the house would be quieter. They wouldn’t deal with my yelling over ridiculous things that I can’t quite control. They would have more money, and extra space in the house. They would be fine eventually.

My sister doesn’t need me. She has her whole life on track. Confident, kind, sweet, and loving. Boys flock to her, she has everything. She is going somewhere in life and I’m not. 

My best friend doesn’t even need me. He’d probably be better off without me because I’ll probably turn him into someone just like me. And no fucking human being as awful as myself needs to be on this earth. He is so popular, he has tons of friends. He’d be over it in no time. 

And even if the world imploded on all those people, i honestly don’t care. I won’t be around to deal with it, so why does it matter? Why should I suffer a miserable existence to keep others happy?

I wish I would go away. I wish I would just disappear. I don’t want to be alive anymore. I don’t want to breathe anymore.

My past suicide attempt failed. I took an entire bottle of pills. The only reason that I lived was because my parents were home and called the ambulance. If they would’ve called 10 minutes later it would’ve been game over. I wish I had waited until they weren’t home.

However, I found the only loaded gun in the house. I know it’s exact location and where it is at right now. Whenever the time comes, I’m ready, and so is the gun. 

Game. Over.",2.0

"Contemplating SuicideI've thought, almost fantasized about hanging myself. Increasingly so recently. It's driven by heartbreak, and I now I sound like a pussy for saying so. But other aspects of my life have just not panned out, and I find it very difficult to achieve the things I seek, even though in reality they are not. It's been a nagging feeling for years, but a couple years ago I found someone who gave me the sense of light at the end of the tunnel. She's been gone 6 months now, won't speak to me, or even allow herself to hear me out. It kills me, and adds a deep pain to everyday. The only thing I feel that keeps me here is my dog, my closest companion aside from her in the past 12 years. My dog is getting old, and isn't doing well, therefore I feel my one true responsibility will soon be gone, and each day that passes I fear more and more the one I love will never give me a chance. Just as my life felt like it was improving she left, in the worst of ways. Normally a person wouldn't have this power over me, but nobody else seems to be able to fill the void. We planned our lives together loosely, and now it all seems for naught. I don't know why I'm posting this. Or what I even expect. But I fear that I may sometime soon succumb to this feeling of wanting to exit this world. I am contemplating hanging myself from a willow tree, morbid but somehow beautiful. I'll try and give it more time for things to improve, but the further we grow apart, the deeper I sink into this emotional abyss. I probably need help in some way, but I don't trust the modern view of being drugged out on prescription drugs, which I assume would be a doctors solution. All I want is the love that made me feel complete. I don't care about having a good job, benefits. Etc. I just want her. I'm probably being selfish, but until I get my chance to be heard, and make clear I can be the one for her, I don't think I will feel better. And the chances of me having that opportunity are fleeting at best. Anyway, if anyone read this, thanks I guess. And if anyone out there is having a harder time than I, I apologize and hope things for you improve as well. But I just can't shake this feeling. Much love.",2.0

I spent the next few years being extremely reckless and impulsive. My home life was never easy I had an odd relationship with most of my relatives except my mom who was probably the only reason why I am even stable to this day. My brother was always seen as the golden child and me as the problem child so I was constantly shamed by extended family for being so impulsive and reckless which we all know is common signs of PTSD in adolescents. I think my mom was ashamed of my initial assault and though I was able to get help I was never allowed to tell anyone about it and a lot of my extended family I didn't even tell until the last couple of years so this has left a strange dynamic for me of not knowing how I feel about telling people my story but also desperately wanting to share it. In 2011 I finally met my husband who is the only reason I'm even doing as successful as I am today.,1.0

"I'm Trying to Leave But Without Others CryingI've attempted suicide twice in the past two weeks. Two weeks ago, I tried walking into traffic but as I did, it gave me the light the cross. I crossed, but didn't try it again. I tried to hang myself yesterday. I tried on the noose to test the durability of the rope, then tried it as an actual attempt, but I picked myself up because I thought of my castmates (I'm in a show at the moment for my school).  I don't know if my suicide would have the show canceled (we open on the 15th) or if everyone would be forced to do it under extreme sadness. And as a second thought, I wonder if people would even miss me, that if I killed myself, my castmates would have no problem continuing the show. I'm just tired of being around everybody while they're happy, and I'm not. I can't find my happiness. I can't find my will to live. I keep trying to leave, but then something positive happens with someone that makes me feel like ""now I can't leave because they'll be another person to leave behind,"" or if something negative happens with someone, I feel like they'd think I did it because of them. After a string of days of no one talking to me, I feel free enough to leave, but then something stops me. It's too bad whatever stops me can't be permanent. I'm trying to leave, but I don't want others to cry or feel guilty. I still have the noose set up. And I've been to the hospital already- voluntarily.

"After the years and tears, I'm ready to go off into the good nightAfter years of desperate soul searching, false awakenings, mumbo jumbo satori enlightenment, and so many attempts to medicate, mediate, and all the magic needed to finally become disillusioned. I have accepted that there is no such thing as more, there is no such thing as anything meaningful hidden or obscured by the light of consciousness. 

The road to self discovery is littered with sentimentality, false desires, and empty promises. The end and the beginning of this road loop right back to one another, its the hero's journey back to the mundane. What's the point of these stories we tell ourselves, when we wake next we're inheriting the mantle of a person who died in a dream state. 

What's the point of living the life of a ghost. The society we live in, the things we seek, the myths we tell, the gods we believe in, the mantle of humanity is an edifice to an endeavor of perception. We live to create an image of the world that is swallowed up into the machine of man. The moon I see today is an illusion that is cast by the lens of the billions that came before me, the poetry, the art, the mystery of the world lies entirely on me and my predecessors professing our love of living. 

This monomyth is the most depressing thing I've ever had the pleasure of witnessing, I hate the feeling of being an I being a thing and being an ego. I hate that I am contained to this meatbag and this mind, I hate living, I despise everything about existing as this thing. This thing that I am should no longer be because I do not wish to inherit this illusion any longer.",2.0

it never totally goes away. 

the longest I've been happy for is half a year, where I had a close group of friends (until my current boyfriend took that away from me) and a job (until the place closed down). 

When I was 6 or 7, I confided to my brother that ""I don't want to live anymore"". I didn't even know the severity of what I said and although my bro was shocked, I don't think he ever told our parents. 

it was around that age where I would always steal the keys for my room's window frame and thought about jumping down (but I knew very well back then 6 floors wasnt enough height to kill me).
 

since then I've fallen into depression, recovered and learnt to love myself (or delude myself into thinking I have recovered), my suicidal thoughts always come back

my parents do not believe me when I talk about my mental health. ""what mental problems do you have?"" my mum replied as she fucking laughed at me. watch me as I OD, would it still be a laughing matter then?

"I dont even know where to start, living for the last 10 years has been painfulIm 24 now, I live alone and it seems like the last 10 years or so has been just an all out self destructive Hello_matey (sorry for the funny SN) spiral. 

I cant seem to get ahead in life. I keep thinking to myself ""If i havnt changed for the better this time next year, im going to kill myself."" Next year rolls around and bam, Im more depressed than before. Im a pretty smart guy, I can fix just about anything and do well in school, but I always seems to intentionally turn myself into the clown of every situation. 

I have basically no relationship with family, I only get random messages from parents wondering if Im still alive. I have no friends because I burn bridges with everyone I know. I havnt had any sort of romantic relationship. 

I really am not looking for sympathy or to hear ""its ok, it will get better."" I want some sort of closure from this miserable existance and why every day I wake up wanting to hang myself. I cant look anyone in the eye because I feel this overwhelming shame about the actions and choices I have made. 

I tried to kill myself today by cutting off circualtion to my brain (rope around neck, pinching carotid ateries) because it seems like a pretty painless way to go. 

I feel like everywhere I go people are laughing at me or mocking me. ",2.0

Exhausted with the struggle and just so tiredI’m just so tired of it all and don’t know what to do anymore. I know I’m not actually brave enough to do anything but I’m just so tired of being miserable and lonely. I cry constantly and feel like I have no one. I can’t even muster up the will to do my hair or bathe half the time. My kitchen is a mess. I just feel like I have lived feeling like crap for so long and I’m just so tired of it. I’m tired of wanting to cry all the time. Im tired of being angry. I’m tired of feeling unhealthy and undesirable. I’m tired of feeling like I am failing at life even when by a lot of standards I’m not. I’m tired of feeling like I can’t even get help because I don’t want to be red flagged. I just want to be ok. I can’t fathom doing this forever and feel so stuck in a permanent hell. Sometimes it gets marginally better and then it always just goes back to hell.,2.0

"Family member came out and said he tried committing suicide twice.. Help?So a family member of mine has been depressed for sometime over marital issues for about two years, he came out a couple days ago and said he tried over dosing on medication. What made him stop the first time, was the birth of his niece. The second time, I was there and didn't even realize it, I thought he was being stupid. He took a pain killer and drank a lot of alcohol, in which I forced him to go vomit for 4 hours and if he didn't feel better  I would call the cops. He told me he felt better. But that was an attempt in front of my eyes I didn't even know.

These all happened two years ago, however he is still depressed and is living on his own. I am scared he is going to hurt himself living by himself. I don't know what to do, I told him what anyone would tell him to please take care of himself and that we all love him, and don't do anything rash.

"I can't do anything about my depression.I've been remotely depressed for a year now but never like this. I just feel like everything is a big joke. I've noticed that the more I grow up, the more I see things around me. And I'm only 16 turning 17 in a few months. I've started to feel depressed last year because of my neglecting father. He ran away 3 times and came back every time due to money and not having a home. The fourth time occurred this summer, he came back and promised to change and my mom told me to make the decision and I agreed. But, what do you know... He runs away because he hates picking me up and dropping me off for sports practices. So he tried to come back (maybe 2 months ago) but I said ""fuck off"" and hasn't seen him since. I've always hated him since I was young. He threw one of my toys at my mom's eyes and ran away to America and that was at the age of 5. 


Now that I'm growing up, I am exposed to a lot of problems. Last year, me and my mother went to finalize our last step to get a green card. But, because my aunt is from my father's side, since my father isn't technically allowed in America, we couldn't get the green card. This makes our life financially harder and we don't have a lot of money. Now, this makes my chance to get into colleges harder because I am an international student. And recently, I've been thinking it about it a lot and the more I thought about it; it led to thinking about a lot of other things in society. And I think society is ridiculous. ",2.0

Basically i've been struggling with suicidal thoughts and severe anxiety bc i decided to go cold turkey on several anti depressants last december. Got me on rehab for a month cause i tried to hang myself due to isolation and my mind going whack but was too much of a puss to follow through. To be honest, i've experienced enough damaging moments in the past year to the point i cant feel a single drop of emotion towards anyone including family and friends. It feels im watching this movie play out in front of me and i'm not a part of it.     i also grew up with undiagnosed adhd that eventually led to low self steem and pushing everyone away . 
My brain conjured up this silly idea to cope  with this,  i told myself  i was this 'badass' movie character that gave zero fucksand  now ive ended up with my sorry ass dropping out of uni twice and an addiction to adrenaline in general( bought me a bike last year and raced till my hearts content, real life weighed down on me when i crashed it, did a lot of drugs)
Long story short, my brain is telling me to pull the plug again. Feel like a fuck up despite all the love i've been givenCurrently unemployed but whatever is left of my spirit and drive tells me ive got a chance at life(loving parents) i think something's snapped up there cause i can barely recognise myself in the mirror.

I'm honestly tempted to just throw myself in the river on Valentines Day as a fuck you to my friends and family because apparently I'm selfish. I might as well prove them right by doing it on a day that would normally be happy for them. But each year on Valentines Day they'd be reminded of what I'd done. Not that anyone would really care.

I mean people in general make you feel like shit, but your friends and family make you feel a hundred times worse than lets say the bus driver who had a go at you for accidentally having the wrong date on your bus pass (which actually happened to me).

But when your family and friends give you shit it just makes you sink lower. You feel genuinely worthless. I know that people would say they only want the best for you, but that's a load of shit. They want the best for themselves, they don't wanna be ''upset'' at our passing. Basically they want us to be miserable forever so they can be ''happy'' forever.

I'm tired of feeling sad
I'm tired of feeling like things are going to improve, while they get worse.
my life is deteriorating all around me.

My parents are only interested in my professional advancement. no one cares about me. My little brothers should never see me like this, so every day I see them I put on a fake smile and go about my day. My friends don't think much of me anyways, my best friend knows something's wrong, but I don't have the heart to tell him what I'm about to do.

It's been 4 years since my last romantic relationship, the woman of which I was with just recently killed herself, to which I was partially to blame for not helping her. I feel so guilty and shamed that such a thing happened. That I wasn't there for her. But recently I forgave myself, turned my attention to getting new friends and perhaps a new love, just to find out that no one really cares for me. I'm so fucking alone. It's just so hard.

Sometimes while driving to work I just feel like putting myself in danger. I drive fast, really fast. sometimes shut my eyes for a second or two. Sometimes I like to think about how easy it would be, just a jerk of the steering wheel and into obliviion i go.

a part of me wants to be better, a part of me wants people to show some compassion for me. I'm not a burden on society, I help people for a living for fucks sake. why can't anyone love me? in the same way that part of me wants it to end. for my sake and for the sake of everyone else around me. the sadness of others is temporary, the one inside me has lasted my whole life. and yes, I AM a bit socially awkward, but I try! I swear I do.

"Emotionally retardedI'll begin by saying that I think I'm a rationally intelligent person. I'm gifted in that way as all things logic-related have always come very naturally to me.

But emotionally, I'm completely retarded, probably on a level of a 6-year-old child. I don't understand my emotions at all, and much less have the ability to deal with them or change them. I feel like a ship on water - completely at mercy of the weather and tides of my emotions.

I can't trust my emotions.  
I often feel extreme desire to do X and make all the plans - and when the time comes and I have to do X, I hate myself for ever bringing myself in that situation. Also, once someone shows any kind of hostility, I can never trust them again, and it makes dealing with my family hard, as they are short-tempered people who can argue to death and then talk happily the next day as if nothing happened - and over the years, I've only grown to resent and hate them more and more.  
So to deal with those kind of problems, I've learned not to listen to my emotions. Well, at least positive ones. The negative ones are harder to ignore.

That's kind of a short analysis of why I feel the way I feel.

I feel like I'll never be fixed. It's been so many years and I'm still the same annoying dysfunctional crybaby who can't even deal with everyday problems. I'm not well-calibrated to this world. My existence will only lead to more pain and suffering for me. And I'm not entitled to other's empathy since I'm not even a good person from most of the people's ethical viewpoints. I'm just an outcast, and I probably did this to myself, and now I'm suffering the consequences.

&amp;#x200B;

And honestly, I can't identify what made me write this post. I don't even like Reddit nor its inhabitants, and I probably won't care for any stranger's ""kind words"" that you might write in the comments. It's easy to be ""kind"" from the comfort of your own room, a computer and an internet connection.",2.0

"I just want to feel like someone cares the way I doIt's been years since I felt like I was someone's top priority. I'm 21 years old, in college, should be having the time of my life but it just seems like I don't matter to anyone. Everyone I try to get close to just doesn't show the same concern, the same care back. People I consider my closest friends know I'm in a rut, and yet nobody calls to check on my like I do, nobody seems to wonder if I'm ok or if I need help.


My past few girlfriends have legitimately left me for other guys. One texting me as we speak telling me about how she left me because she likes his voice better. Like am I actually that bad of a person that I can be replaced by someone with a better voice? My own family doesn't seem the slightest concerned with me being the way I am. I've tried to talk to them about what I'm struggling with and I get responses like ""You just got to get it together"" and ""It's not that hard to get up and get moving"". 


I just don't know what's wrong with me that I'm not a priority to anyone. I know that people say there's always someone that cares, and I know that. I just want back what I put out. I want someone to talk to me first, someone to ask me to go somewhere, someone that just wants to be around me because they like to. But I'm not good enough, and I don't know what to change to be that for someone. 


Anyways today was my breaking point. I don't know how much longer I can do it. I go to work and class with a mask on because everyone wants to be entertained, not stressed by some depressed loner.

Ultimately,I feel like scum for living in my own head more than on the outside,although I refuse to do anything to change it.I deserve not what was given to me from birth and if only I didn't care about the people i've interacted with just enough so I despise the idea of potentially hurt anyone at the news of my death,I would have already left.",2.0

My views on the world, humanity, life in general is dark, nihilistic, somewhat misanthropic and filled with absurdity and abstract thoughts about apocalypse and death. So even if my mood changed and got better somehow, I still doubt that my views on the world and the future would change. 







Am not religious but I don't have a problem for not believing in god. Tho I can't feel anything about him. 







I don't see a point to continue, I will cause people to suffer my death, especially my mother. She suffered in this world more than I can bare and she's still handling it. She sees me as her source of happiness and meaning. She says words like: ""you're the hope in my life"" ""your the only one who feels me"". Her words are what make me guilty or hesitant. Tho am not sure if I can keep up with all of this. I wish from the bottom of my heart that she dies so she can rest. I don't see her nor me living is anyway good. Me being born was one of the major sources of her suffering. Sometimes I even think about killing her so I can just end it so I don't make her sad if I left her trapped here. It's fucked up 






Am planning on throwing away everything am attached to. I'll give my guitar away for a friend. I'll announce giving all my books away. I've gathered those books throughout the years from around the world. London, Turkey, US, and Amazon. They're not much but they're the biggest thing am attached right now. I'll burn whatever left untaken. This image of me burning all the books with bookshelfs' fire is quite appealing. 






After that .... I'll be ready to leave this world







Anyone has any reason to why I shouldn't be doing this. Because I am little bit hesitant. I don't see any reason to keep living. The world is just boring and everything has already been repeated millions of times. I know where life will lead me and I can imagine myself living for the next 50 years ..... Nothing interesting in it. 






Tldr; any reason to keep living?",2.0
"My mom then hit me with the newspaper and it shocked me that she would do this, she knows I don't like play hitting, smacking, striking, hitting or violence of any sort on my person. Do I send out this vibe asking for it from the universe? Then yesterday I decided to take my friend to go help another ""friend"" move to a new place. While we were driving the friend we are moving strikes me on my shoulder. And I address it immediately because this is the 4th time I have told him not to do these things, then my other friend who is driving nearly gets into an collision with another car i think because he was high on marijuana and the friend we are moving in the backseat is like ""you have to understand I was just trying to get your attention"" you know the thing 5 year olds do to get peoples attention by smacking them, this guy is in his 60's.",1.0

"RooftopI'm on the rooftop right now taking my cat for a walk as always. I like this place. It's mostly lonely, calm, and you can see the city around. I'm really sad right now. I like to imagine myself jumping and splatting on the ground, over and over again. Or shooting myself here. I've even chosen the spot I want to sit and shoot myself. I like to fantasize on the moment of how people are going to find me, how loud is it going to be, how much is going to hurt probably, my brain on the ground. I come here everyday to take my cat for a walk, but I like to imagine the silence and fantasize about a world without people, as if suddenly everyone disappeared from earth. I come every night to see the stars and the moon and my own shadow. I like to imagine myself as a ghost in the afterlife. Sometimes on specially bad days I climb the fence. I think about my cat and how is she going to take it. No one is going to take care of her when I'm gone. She will die of hunger. So I go back. I wish I could talk with anyone but I tire people out and it's understandable. I cannot expect for anyone to put on with my shit when they have their own problems. I don't wish that for anybody either. Sometimes I go to online listeners but sometimes I can't freely talk freely about what I think because they will either call the cops on me or they ban certain ""way of speech"" in their sites. I wish there was some kind of robot or AI I can talk so I don't feel like I'm being a burden everyday. Because even if no one says it I can see when they are getting tired of me and my everyday talk. How can they not. I'm like a scratch record just like many people.

At least I can talk about it hear, even if no one reads it I feel like I'm getting it out a little bit. ",2.0

"once attempted does visualization ever endAs a kid I made a couple decent attempts, foiled by too skilled driver and survival instinct; gave up trying after that, but the visualization of attempting and willingness to contemplate at any hard juncture just won't fade.   Even now, in a good place mentally, addressed most issues, relatively happy, I was just laying back, tracing the outlines of the ribs under my breast and locating the heart, wondering xxxxxx rules bah xxxxxxxxxxx or whether I should get up and check an anatomy guide first.

"Something I wrote during my hard time...It was another night


It was another episode


The burdens I had in my mind


Even my thoughts couldn’t control


It was the same tub 


The songs were the same


I just felt so numb 


While I acted sane 


The water was hot 


Yet the chills made it cold


I had a razor on my right


About which I felt bold


Everything felt depressed


While nothing could be expressed 


The razor went deep 


And so did the blood 


The water turned cold


While I witnessed a flood


The water turned red


And so did my face 


The walls turned darker


On which laid an apology 


Written with a marker


I carried no regrets 


And so do I now 


As I woke up in the hospital


Witnessing my life frown

(PS. I’m glad nothing really worked out back then... I’m still going through shit but I’m fighting to live another day,

"I don’t want to, but I think about it a lotHey everyone, 

So idk how to go about this but I think about ending it everyday. I can’t be alone because I start to hate myself. I try to do school work but the effort is gone. I go on social media to distract myself from my thoughts but’s it’s almost inevitable to think about them before bed. I don’t think I will go through with it, but I feel like it’s getting worse and worse as I just sit in my room, and I just don’t want it to get too far. I’ve tried talking to my parents about it but they blew it off only because they don’t want me on pills if needed. I also talked to my doctor about looking into anxiety or depression but he didn’t want to because the pills. I understand, but I’m tired of feeling sick all the time and why live when you can just you know, not exist.

Im at a university and thought about looking into their counselors they provide, but I feel like I can’t share anything with anyone because I’ll receive the same neglect. I’m really tired.

Can anyone please recommend some methods or practices that help remove these thoughts. What steps can I take to help myself?

All I know is that I feel the most devastating feeling. Why? I don’t exactly know. All I know is that this is my last night. Well let me start I guess. 

I don’t have parents. They both died in a car crash when I was 5. Everyone always makes fun of me for that. Stupid reason huh? I didn’t choose it. I forgot how real parents love feels like. 

I did have a boyfriend. 3 years actually. Started out pretty young aha. He dumped me 2 days ago. I think I was actually in love but who am I to know? I hope he reads this somehow. I don’t know if that was love but I could never imagine a better feeling than that. I was the happiest girl. He always listened, supported me. Showed me to everyone in his life. I lost my virginity only 3 months ago with him. You know what? Maybe that’s it. I am starting to realise it just now. He started pulling away. For the last few days he didn’t want to go out because I wasn’t interesting enough. A few more days and he tells me that he is done with me. Why? Because ‘I’m a fucking idiot without any brains’. Yes that’s the reason. What did I say? Nothing. I just broke everything I had around me. 

I am wonderful in school. I learn everyday until about 1am. I am so tired I can’t take it anymore. I wanted to study in a uni but everyone said I wasn’t good enough so why even try? I was bullied all my life. Why? I also don’t know. I’m not good enough. I don’t have a single friend. It was only him. Not a single one. 

What I feel right now isn’t what I wanted from life. I fought so hard but I give up. I know I know, I am so young, so many things waiting for me. Well I don’t want to know what’s waiting for me. What I feel isn’t happiness. Not even a little bit. My heart hurts physically. I think I am finally strong enough. 

I want to say sorry to my grandma and my brother. I love you but I can’t. I guess I’ll meet my parents soon.  Although I don’t believe in afterlife. And to my ex lover - You promised you would always be here. Look at me know. Are you happy? You told me to do it.

"Never thought I'd post here but its all come crashing down today...Ive actually grown to hate myself more than I ever had in just the past hour or so. It's a really long story, and i know im a complete asshole and piece of shit for it but I'll be happy, just to know that i was able to tell just someone what was going through my mind...

Backstory is, I was my parents' unwanted accident child and i never felt like i was wanted anywhere. Any friends that I made were just people to pass the time, none of them actually cared about me. I never even planned to live past high school and I was just deadset on making it to 18 then leaving. Then, I met my best friend, purely by chance since we were partnered for taking care of a club for just a day. I genuinely just grew to love her and before I knew it she became the only reason I had to live. I actually, thought there might be something worth living past 18 for. But, keep in mind the past 17 years of my life i built myself up in my mind to be a worthless piece of shit that can't do anything right and I genuinely couldn't understand why she wanted to stick around with me. And therein is the root of my jealousy.

[This section makes me feel like a complete piece of shit] I really, couldn't handle her spending more time with lther people than myself, I kept thinking that it was only a matter of time before she woke up and realized there were plenty of better people she could have in her life. Evem though she constantly tried to reassure me that she never was going to leave or replace me. But I still just couldn't believe any of it.

Fast forward to just tonight where i came off a really shit day and really just hated myself. She invited me to join her and a friend of mine in a game and, I just lost it... I, i really dont know what happened but i just ended up pushing her away and just saying that the day she ended up replacing me, please have it be one of the only people i considered an actual friend. The second i said that i really regretted it. Too little too late though, cause i could tell i crossed a line and no matter what kind of apologies I made it didn't make a difference since she probably hates me now anyway. Now im just, sitting here writing this on my phone while trying to keep myself from tossing myself off the deep end.

Like maybe sometimes its better/easier to not go to therapy and revisit everything and try to get ahold of it yourself? I definitely do have a skill set learned from my time in therapy that I feel I can rely on right now, but if I get worse I am not sure if just that is enough...though hopeful I will not get worse. Would appreciate your feedback whether you also share these feelings, or if you think it is better to return to therapy.",1.0

"I feel so alone. (Long sorry)Ok. I’m a 28 y/o white male in the south in the us. I’ve moved several states away from my family and even further from my only sibling. 

I constantly think about ending it. Almost every day. Sometimes multiple times a day. 

I grew up in a Georgia southern baptist household where dad went to night bible college and worked a corporate flooring exec job during the day. 

Dad was suffering from severe depression and transgender issues. Later fully transitioned to female. 

During the time before and growing up in the 90’s with limited access to the internet it later became apparent that all of dads weird hospitalizations were due to depressive self half. Of the genitals. 

Flash forward and I realize that all the verbal and sometimes physical abuse I received were a direct result of the mental problems my former pops ha(s)d. 

To this day I still feel worthless. Empty. Lost. 

I dated a girl for collectively about 5 years. Lost it. Bc I can’t keep my shit together. I can’t stay sober for more than 24 hours. Off anything. 

I hate myself. I hate everything about me. ",2.0

"Just an emotional Gen z who needs to get over myself and my self loathingCan I rant. Vent about my problems, speak my true mind without it getting bottled up in my head. Please. 
For my whole fucking life I’ve been told I’m too emotional and I need to get over myself. 
Since I was 8 I fantasized about my life ending. But I’m not serious, I’m just being dramatic. Apparently. 
I’ve tried to tell my mom and family about how I feel but they just tell me it’s an excuse to get on pills because I need attention. 
Everyday I feel numb. The only thing I feel other than numb is sadness. The sadness burns through my arms and legs, especially in my palms. It’s physically hurts. 
I cry like fucking 8 times a week, and every time I reach out I’m told I’m just emotional. 
I don’t believe I have a purpose on this earth because I can’t see what I could possibly bring to people. I am narcissistic, selfish, mean, vain and annoying. I have no self love and everyone that ever meant something to me hates me now. 
I dropped out of college because I hated it, but can’t find any other path in my life. 
My boyfriend stares at other girls asses and talks about how other girls look good. He won’t have sex with me and criticizes my outfits. 
Woe is me. 
I don’t have a close family and all my friends moved away. 
Is ending it cowardly or is it something only people with courage do. 
Can’t seem to figure it out.

Every day I'm tempted to kill myself, emotionlessly until I think of my mother or fathers reaction, especially when I saw my father (who is a professional boxer and a personal trainer) be reduced to tears at my grandmothers funeral with me at his side consoling him.

He gets caught in this negative thought cycle and he can’t seem to get out of it. 

He expects himself to be amazing at everything, the first time. He plays football and he loves it and he is good at it. (The coaching staff doesn’t yell, there isn’t any Friday night yikes going on here.)

It’s not.

You realize how insignificant you are in this society, that despite all the pain and suffering you were going through, not even a single leaf on a branch has gone out of it’s place. 

At first you feel tiny and weaker than you’ve ever felt. Then, you feel a weird comfort in these facts. 

Nothing will change.

Not the breeze, nor the sky. 

It’ll all still be there even when you’re gone.

"It was the same therapist I'd been seeing since I was little, when I was first diagnosed as ASD (at the time termed PDD-NOS, as I didn't *quite* fit the diagnostic requirements for Aspergers), and she, had honestly stopped being helpful. Just kept telling me to do the same things over and over, when I told her these solutions either didn't work, or in some cases (going out for a walk for the sake of it, rather than with an intended destination/goal, for instance) made things worse. Because if my mind's left to wander, without something to focus on, something to distract myself, it starts tearing itself apart, ripping open old wounds and rubbing salt in them; reminding me of all the shit I've screwed up in the past, ways I've failed or fallen short, and I end up worse off than when I started. So, I eventually stopped going. And then, eventually stopped taking my meds, mostly because of not having the money to afford them when my father walked out, and the house practically started falling down around our ears over a course of a couple years; the heating just before winter because we couldn't afford oil, then losing water due to burst pipes, then the gas and finally electricity due to nonpayment.",1.0

I don’t want to give up my depression and suicidal ideation because it keeps me from being anxious.No matter how depressed and suicidal I become it is always easier for me to deal with my depression than my anxiety. Because when I’m anxious I become a different person. I get so irrational and delusional that I get really close to losing my mind every time. That isn’t an exaggeration. My depression makes me feel like shit but at the same time the feeling paradoxically makes me happy. Something about depression just feels so warm. It’s like home. Maybe it’s just the feeling that if life does end up being a total dumpster fire I still have a backup plan. I know that’s not healthy but it’s still better than the panic attacks.,2.0

My ex girlfriend has been having suicidal thoughts for a while now, I've always made sure to be there for her when I can, and every time she has agreed to keep on fighting if I'm there to help her.

About an hour ago, however, she said that she couldn't take it anymore. She said that she was going to go kill herself, and to say anything I had to say to her now, because she was leaving her phone at home and going. I said to her ""You've been here before, you can get through it."" but didn't get a reply. After about 10 minutes I tried calling her, but to no answer. I know what she's like, so called her parents and explained the situation. They've spent the past hour or so driving around looking for her, but can't find her anywhere, she has no phone or anything to be contacted through, and has left no clue as to places she might be.

I can't think of anywhere special that we've been together in her area, so that's not help either.

I have pulled completely away from family, and in fact have had no contact with 99% of them in a couple of years. I'm alone, except for 2 cats. And because of growing up in poverty, then remaining in poverty because of taking care of both parents through cancer my teeth are in pretty bad shape and that also causes social issues. I'm fairly OK at this moment, but I can tell you exactly what gun-oil tastes like. ",2.0

I barely had enough this paycheck to cover just the single payment; when this extra payment processes it's going to cost me an overdraft fee.

"Confused and FrustratedThis is obviously a throw-away account.

I am not yet in crisis.  But I know I am swiftly reaching that point.

I am 30 years old, not married.  I have two advanced degrees.  I work two jobs.  I am fairly successful.  I am disabled, but it's something that I can work with.  I fought for everything I have.

I have a caring but dysfunctional family.  They are less well-off than me financially, and sometimes I feel as though the only thing KEEPING me from going into crisis is the fact that I am the only one keeping the different groups of my family afloat.  I don't say this to brag.  I say this for perspective.  It should not be this way.

I shouldn't feel this way, but I feel so empty.  Not in the spiritual or religious sense.  Just... like there's a hole.  A malfunction.  I have horrible luck in relationships, but there are people worse off than I am.

I have been screened for depression.  After several rounds of different medications, I was taken off of all of the pills.  They just did not seem to make a dent.

Now, the thing is, I really am a bad person. I have bad thoughts about everybody. I just hate to be around people, sometimes I even have physical pain from this. And I get jealous at everything and everybody. Don't know how to really explain what I mean here, but I don't want other peolpe to be happy or successful, I wish bad things would happen to them.

"Not suicidal, but also don't particularly want to live. And I'm pretty sure I had a heart attack yesterday.So I've struggled with thoughts of suicide since I was a kid, but I've strongly convinced myself that I don't want to kill myself, for a number of reasons.  But I’m having issues figuring out how to think about recent events.

I'm currently self-employed and uninsured.  The uninsured part is stupid, I know, but I don't think it makes *too* much of a difference here, given how I feel about this.

I was running an errand on my motorcycle yesterday, and I started feeling uncomfortable - in particular my chest was feeling tight and I started feeling weak.  I tried to ignore it at first, but pretty soon I felt like I had to stop and get water or I would pass out.  I pulled into a fast food place, ordered some fries and got a water.  After a few bites and several cups of water, I felt a bit better.  But a few minutes later I just wanted to lay down and / or vomit.

I went outside, walked to a nearby parking lot so that hopefully people wouldn’t see me, and laid down on the pavement.  I threw up a bit later.  And then my left arm went numb.  I kinda suspected what was going on at that point, but my phone told me that even if this wasn’t a heart attack, I needed to go to the hospital *right now*.

Heh, then I looked up how much a heart attack costs.  So I decided not to call 911, and figured that, while this is a super pathetic way and place to die, I’m ok with letting go here.

And...after an hour I felt ok.

Today I just felt tired.  I tried going for a walk, and my chest hurt again, and I had to head back home.

I’m pretty sure I survived a heart attack yesterday.

If I’m wrong, this is all relatively fine.  Still, obviously, the right thing to do is to go to a doctor and get checked out.  But I’m not doing that.

If my heart *isn’t* half-dead, that’s great.  But really, if it is, I’d rather just die than face the rest of my life in financial ruin.

So I guess I’m struggling to figure out how to think about all this, and what I should do.

It seems like there are a bunch of things I should do if I think I’m about to die, but even if I maybe almost died yesterday - even if I did have a heart attack - I could still also probably live for years.  I don’t want to scare people by talking about dying, but I also don’t want to be gone unexpectedly when I had the opportunity to say goodbye and make arrangements.

"Burst of energy after ""suicide attempt""So a week ago I had one of those **really** bad days. Ended up cutting myself for the first time and tried to strangle myself with a scarf. I know. Really stupid method. But that's not the point.

After I ripped the scarf of my neck and the color returned to my face I had this sudden burst of energy and I actually felt better. Idk. It was so weird. Adrenaline kicked in? Or endorphins released from cutting?

"PointlessThe only thing that i see as worth living for is my family. I don’t see a point in growing up just to struggle to get by and probably end up failing. i’ll never succeed in an office environment. the only field i could be efficient in is music and im not good compared to the tens of thousands of other aspiring musicians. i’ll never be anything and i know that i will broke and struggling to get. 

on top of that, i can’t escape depression and anxiety. i’ve been on 20+ different medicines and been to different therapies and none of them help. depression and anxiety have ruined me. they make me a little shit who doesn’t talk to or interact with their parents or show them any thankfulness. it makes me feel like a complete piece of shit for not treating them well. the only thing i wasn’t right now is to one day be able to support them and help them get by and live comfortable but i’ll never be able to do that. they’ve given their everything to me. they spent a combined $28k for my freshman and sophomore years of *HIGH SCHOOL* and now they’re gonna end up paying $24k more for my next 2 years of high school and then eventually college. killing myself would be even shittier because they love me and care and have spent so much time and effort on me. 

i’ll never be anything and lack so much motivation and i’m such a shitty worker. i’ll never have a good job or have any money. 

life along with the realities of the world aren’t appealing to me. i’m gonna have to deal with depression and anxiety for my whole life and i do not want to live with that. i’m basically numb to emotion and i suck at everything social. i can never express my gratitude for people or things that people do for me. 

if my current friends wouldn’t have ever taken the initiative to reach out to me in the first place, i would’ve never been brave enough to reach out to them. 

life. sucks. 

i find peace in the though of death. i won’t be conscious of my being and i will be at peace. however, the people that care about me, the ones that i don’t show anything in return, they won’t be at peace. 

Edit: oh ya, and i’ll probably never find love. i started my first relationship last december and i ended it three weeks later because i couldn’t get myself to truly enjoy it. i’ll never get the balls to approach anyone and start a relationship ",2.0

I just want it to be over. Any good in my life is sucked away by the pervasive darkness of my mind. I'm in the worst depressive episode of my life right now. It already was intensely suicidal at the start of the summer, when everything in my life was going exactly how I would like. Amazing girlfriend, good new job, great friends, supporting family, plenty of things to do that I was eager to do. Yet I still just wanted to end it. Now my girlfriend left me, my dad almost died in a car accident 3 days later, and the job stresses me out beyond what I can handle and allows my thoughts to build and build and build. I barely keep myself from screaming and running out of work in tears and my parents have such a hastle with dealing with my dad's injuries that I don't want to bog them down and take more money. I don't want help (done inpatient treatment, CBT, and medication), I want it to be over. I feel like I'm being ripped apart in a hurricane of emotion and I can't fucking deal with it anymore. What's the point in going on if every good thing that happens will eventually get torn down by my fucked up mind. It just doesn't seem worth it and even stuff I want to do in the future doesn't make me want to live enough to push aside these urges.

"Being trans is gonna be the death of meI hate being trans. I fucking hate it. What a miserable, pathetic existence. It’s fucking isolating. Cis people don’t understand what it’s like to feel trapped in your own body disgusted by it because it ISN’T YOU. It’s the complete opposite of who you are. Everyday the dysphoria gets worse. I haven’t transitioned yet idk if there’s a point if I’ll never have a cis male body. I didn’t ask for this. I didn’t choose this body, I don’t want it. I hate looking at myself. Yeah I know there’s nothing wrong with the female body objectively. But it’s not me. My experience is being female is shit. Not the social aspects cause men and women face their own difficulties, but the fact I’m a man in a woman’s body. I am in hell. Hell is my own body. Even if I transition I will still have this piece of shit body that has already undergone female puberty. It will take thousands to get surgery. I will never have a dick that functions exactly like a cis man’s. What’s the fucking point if I still retain primary and secondary sex characteristics. Even if I pass as a man and everyone sees me as one at first glance, that’s not enough. There will be people that knew me before I transitioned. They will always have the memory of me as a “girl”. Fuck that shit. I won’t be satisfied. I’ll never be happy. 

Every time I see cis men I think why couldn’t that be me. If I were born a cis man I wouldn’t be suffering like this. No one would doubt my gender, I say I’m male they don’t think otherwise. Makes me feel fucking stupid when I even say I’m a (trans) guy. I don’t look like one. I’ll always be less of a man. Dysphoria is driving me insane. I’m reminded every waking moment of what I’m not, and what I am. I’m getting tired of this. I’m a waste of space. There is no point in living if I’ll never be content with who I am.

Everyone thinks he's a great guy, but since I got laid off 3 years ago I've driven myself mad trying to hold things together. He really is a talented entrepreneur, but he is aging out of his business fast and he won't modernize.

I was never able to get another decent job. I used to be beautiful, but like many women my age, my looks are going. We don't have sex anymore, he doesn't know how to touch me and never cared to learn. I have always been disappointed by love. I've had my heart broken a few times, so I never got to experience my soulmate.

I have two wonderful children who are happy, independent and grown up. I am so saddened by the state of the world and the fact that no one seems to value older people anymore that I'm just ready to go. Everything just seems to be getting worse.

I haven't had a mammogram in ten years, I don't take blood pressure medication, I don't get my moles checked. I'm not interested in living any longer. 

I put on a good show for everyone. I don't want to die too soon, my mother is still living. She's vital, financially secure. Of course, she's a republican boomer who had a government job so she's set for life. I'd like to not die before her, but if I do, I do.

I'm taking anti depressants, I exercise, I don't drink to excess. I just don't want to be here anymore. Having to worry about money for the rest of my life terrifies me, and I would just rather sleep.

I probably should go to the hospital, but I'm even afraid to do that.   They wouldn't believe me.    I don't care if I have to go inpatient for awhile, but they probably would kick me out.

I fail and fail and fail every single day. Everyone at work is getting promoted and I'm a purchaser with no future. I'm 26 and I'm going no where. I have a criminal record so I can't even live on my own. I can't get any better job than the one I have now.  ,2.0
It’s my Birthday and I want to die more then ever.Today is my birthday so I went to a Starbucks Drive Through to get my birthday drink. Other then that I haven’t left the house for anything other then essentials and even then hardly ever because my Father is high risk. I come home to my sister screaming at my saying I’m a hypocrite because I beg and plead for her to take this virus seriously. She has her Trump supporter boyfriend over constantly and disappears for hours at a time doing god knows what. I’ve pretty much resigned myself to the fact that we are not going to survive this virus but it’s just so frustrating.,2.0

"Every 2 years for the past few years, someone at my school kills themselves on the last day of the Autumn school holidays. That's tomorrow.I'm petrified for tomorrow. At my school (5 years) someone has killed themselves on the last day of the April break every two years. The reason why I'm scared is because I've been thinking of killing myself consistently for the past few days, and I'm so scared that if it isn't me who kills myself, it'll be someone better, with more friends and a good future. 

My friends are in the process of trying to cut me out, my grades are dropping, I have no clue what to do with my life even in Year 12. I'm the perfect person out of everyone at my school who should be victim to this weird curse. I can think of four people from my school who would mourn me, and though I have family, I'm nowhere on the path to make them proud enough and staying alive longer would just cause more pain and disappointment in the long run. 

There are so many logical reasons to kill myself. I've had a plan for how to do it set out for a couple of years. Everything is telling me it's time for me to die. I turned 17 last month, and I was so proud of myself for getting past 16, when I planned to kill myself last time. Everything is telling me I wasn't meant to last this long and I'm so scared I'll be the one to die tomorrow.

"I’m 17 and I have thought of how and when to kill myself more in these past two years than I have in six years.I’m 17 and these past two years I have thought of killing myself more than I have in the past six years (that’s how long I’ve been struggling). I just found out I failed one of my IB classes, which is the first time I’ve ever failed a class. And right before college applications need to be sent out makes it all the worse. I just try so hard in that class and I still get the lowest grade amongst my peers. It sucks. The teacher gives me suggestions on how to improve and I try them but they never work. I think I’m doomed to not make it into any of my colleges and just end up dead by my own hand. 
It sucks thinking of it this way and people say that one bad grade isn’t going to determine the rest of your life but that’s not true. This is one of the most important years of my high school career and I just feel terrible. I can’t even talk to anyone because my mom believes that there are certain people who deserve to be depressed and a “spoiled brat” like me doesn’t fit into any of those categories. 
Right now, my future is uncertain but I know that I will either kill myself before this school year ends or when I turn 30. Sorry for the rant, but as I said I can’t talk to anyone and I just needed to get it all out. ",2.0

But just now he said.

""Look, you told me to tell you if it gets to this point. I think I'm gonna try something when she's at work this week.

I was thinking maybe I'd take a bunch of tylenol and ibuprofen, then knock myself out with benadryl. Perfect OD and can't be saved if after 4 hours. That's something I came up with while ""thinking"" today.
Tylenol kills the liver so even if you manage to survive the overdose you'll get sepsis quickly, and ibuprofen causes kidney damage and internal bleeding.

I feel like there is no point in living unless you have a job and economy like youtubers or song artists who wipe their asses with 100 dollar bills while we can barely get food on the table.

Why do we need school? Im sick of it, people treat it like its a godlike thing while we go to school, barely fight to get through it and then? Then after we waste 12+ years of our childhood we continue to work like goddamn slaves for little food that we can get.

I get it money doesnt bring happiness but it gets you the freedom of being able to do what you want.

We have been taught that being greedy is bad, but really every single person is greedy and they are just scared of admiting it.

Im just afraid of ending up homeless, or failing school because our whole life depends on it.

Im currently wanting to start recording dor youtube because i truly love that and it can bring wealth, i am planning to quit school if that doesnt work out cause its my last resort.

Are there any ways to fight this depression? I know i sound like a stereotypical teen but thats how it is.

Thanks for reading and sorry for errors as i am on a phone.

"Now I'm nothing but a failing financial burden.Everyone I talk to about my future thinks it's bright. I've got clear goals, a lot of passion, a direction I'm heading in.

I recently got my first article published (as an undergad! I was so proud!). It was something I slaved away on for WEEKS. And no one seems to care that it happened. 

I have a 3.8 GPA, three majors, and I've basically given up my life this past year to focus on school. I have no job, no money, and have pretty much isolated myself. All I think about is art, my future in museums, and who in my class will surpass me. I've held several internships, attended conferences, and nothing I do ever seems to be enough in the museum/art world.

Then my computer broke. Then my car broke. I have credit card debt. I can barely pay my rent (parents still help me, I'm a loser, I know). I dumped my boyfriend, and still have feelings for an older ex-boyfriend, who just wants to fuck me. I had to turn down an overseas internship this summer because of money. I have nothing. 

My history of anxiety makes me stressed all the time. I take herbals, have pillow-sprays, relaxation techniques, but the stressors just won't leave.

I'm failing at everything I wanted to do, and costing my divorced parents a shit ton of money while I'm at it. I hate being this financial burden, making them pay for my car repairs, a new computer, my rent...because I just can't. 

I used to feel so above everyone in my intelligence, drive, confidence, looks. Now, I've stopped eating (5'4, 101 right now), dropped my cockiness down way low, and books have become my best friends. This is not how I want to live. 

What if I sold the car, sold the computer, all the nice clothing I've collected, wrote letters to those I love and just checked out? People would be sad, but at this point--not many. I've become so isolated I've lost most of the people I used to care about. I'm a failure, and I'm faking happy every day at school. This isn't how I want to live, and I think every day at night, ""I don't want to live like this, so what if I just didn't anymore?""",2.0

"I'm so confused about how I feelRecently the treatment I've been receiving for my depression suddenly started working and I went out to my friends for the first time in several months. I feel like I have renewed energy and like I could even go back to my school I left several years ago. 

However, I feel this persistent and overbearing desire to have my life come to an end. Whenever I think about the future I think about existing until I can kill myself. Even though it feels like I'm able to function I don't want to exist. I don't want to live.

I guess I'm just going to go through the motions until I gather enough courage to put myself out of my misery. For what it's worth I'm a worthless coward so I won't be hurting myself today. I also fear involuntary psychiatric care more than anything else so I won't be taking any chances. I'll just go to sleep and hope I don't wake up I can't stand this stupid life I don't even know how I feel I just want to stop existing I hate it.

"I've set a dateI'm going to kill myself on December 30th if nothing gets better by then.

My story: 
I've dealt with anxiety, ocd, and panic since I was about 3 years old. I would line up my toys and if one was missing I would freak out. Fears escalated to diseases, rare illnesses, and cleanliness. There was a good half a year where I washed my hands like 20 times a day. 

Once middle school hit this turned into a more social anxiety. I was obsessed with fitting in. With having friends. With not being alone. 
Pretty normal stuff.

Then softmore year. I had a massive panic attack while smoking weed and felt derealization for the first time ever. I obsessed over it for months until one day I kind of just stopped. 

That obsession came back 2 years later. Worst 6 months of my life. Then I met the love of my life. Literally the most beautiful girl I've ever met. My mental health issues disappeared for a short time. 

Fast forward a few months. I start obsessing again. Constantly ruminting. Every day all day. My obsessions range from obsessing over emotions, like trying to hard to feel them, to obsessing over unanaswerable existential questions. 

When I say this is all day every day, I mean it.

Fast forward to today. Girlfriend broke up with me 3 months ago. Said I didn't make her happy anymore. At this point I've seen 6 different therapists, I've tried every kind of therapy, ERP, CBT, etc. I've seen 4 different psychiatrists, tried 4 different meds. Nothing. At this point I'm so far into my own head I can't even really feel emotions. I'm just blank, and sometimes I panic and I'm always depressed. I can't do this anymore. Even if there's better times head it's just not worth it. This is who I am, I'll never be able to get out of my own head. I don't want to live anymore. There's no cure to anxiety ocd and depression. I can't deal with this for my whole life, even if it's managed. I'm not strong enough.

"I would rather kill myself than hurt other people so why the fuck did that even occur to me? My therapist told me I'm meant to be alive and hugged me and I don't even know why because how could I be meant to be alive if I have thoughts like this? What's the point? It honestly feels like depression or ptsd or whatever this is has stripped me of normal human emotions and humanity and I'm just like this vacuum moving around undetected that people, like my therapist, fail to see is awful and unlovable and unfixable.

"What's wrong with me?Hi.

Meds: prozac 60mg
Past meds: zoloft, celexa, effexor, mirtazapine, seroquel.

Most recent crisis: last Sunday I tried to slice my wrists with a Santoku kitchen knife. Just sat on the couch with the knife ready on my wrist to slice listening to some music for about 10 mins before giving up.

Daily thoughts: I sing in my head and sometimes out loud disgusting things. Stuff like fucking donkeys or donkeys fucking you. I often take real world songs and lyrics and change them to disgusting lyrics. Only I find it funny. I sometimes make jokes like... how can a man aid in childbirth... get a boner and stick it in her pussy just before she's about to push... then the baby can hopefully have something to hold on to on its way out. Yeah... disgusting. Vile. Horrific. But it makes me laugh. I was bullied and beaten up daily at school years ago. I actively try to find the guy that did it all not to beat him up.. but to tie him up and let him watch me beat the shit out of his kid or kids... fuck it... maybe I'll rape them too. Whatever will hurt him the most. I used to go to a kids gym after school and the owner would bully me... tell my mum I stole stuff when I never did. She locked me out the house for a whole night. He regularly beat me. He even once pulled another kids pants down and whizzed him around a trampoline saying ""hey girlies this is what a cock looks like wahoo"". I recently found him on Facebook and threatened him. I told him his time is coming and that one day he will regret everything he did. I'm also obese and eat a lot of ice cream. I'm only 5 foot 6 but I'm 95 kilos.

Reality: deep down I know something is wrong. Seriously fucking wrong and I know what I think and do all day is wrong... but I always have one side of me telling me... to do it all... because it's justice. It's what they all deserve. I try meds... therapies... listen to my wife reasoning with me when I say or do things... but it always seems to get ignored.

What I want: help. Please help me.",2.0

"Thank youI joined this subreddit because I want to stay strong for my ex. Not because for my own good but because I want to set my ex free from the pain that keep inflicting to her.

I am staying away from her because I know having me will only bring her misery. Though, I really wish I can be strong enough to make myself better so we can have another chance.

I am the dumpee, our relationship was my second relationship ever. I have really trust issues after I was being cheated on by my bestfriend in HS (my first relationship). It did a huge number on me on many aspects. One in particular is my mental health. I have survived multiple suicide attempts in the past. After 2 years, I finally have become brave and ready to take another shot. However, I can see that the past (which I thought already healed to a certain extent) contributed to the break up and it blows me really hard.

I don't know what to do rn honestly. I want to come to her again, she was so warm and I can say that I haven't been felt that relaxed in my life after being cheated on. I'm trying so bad to hold on everything but I must say, as the day goes on, it gets worse; I'm losing my battle that I have fought fiercely for years.

I did counseling, hanging out, working out (I have sixpack now for the first time in my life), making myself better, throw myself to work, anything that anyone suggest on doing. But something is still missing. And I don't know what is it anymore. Keep crying every single night is tiring. Worst part is, once you go home, I know I wouldn't be able to hold everything like when I was outside (fakingly being happy).

So, I want to say to this community, thank you for the love and support that I have received while I was here. I see myself not getting better. I wish all the people will be stronger than me with their healing. I am grateful to be able to join this community even for a short while.

Thank you. Feel free to message me before 1st of April. Because I'm planning to leave on that day. I will reply as much as I can. /Sorry, if this post is similar to my other post because I basically want to say relatively the same thing/",2.0

I seem to have these bouts of anxiety. I'm not constantly anxious but if something worries me enough there's a good chance I'll start on this downward spiral.

"Hello, just tryna help any way I can.Hey there, my name is Biosane (not gonna use my real name for privacy purpose). I too am a suicidal person, and I tried to kill my self a long time ago after all my past sorrows and pain caught up to me (by making a makeshift noose out of my mothers shoals. I made sure it would not break/rip on me by clinging on it). I decided to roleplay one last time and while roleplaying- I started to talk to a girl who was having a bad day, and because she said she had fun roleplaying with me- that girl is my Ex. Yes, after a few months she confessed she had feelings for me, and we dated for 3 and a half years. She saved me from killing myself and gave me a purpose to live. Unfortunately it wasn't meant to be...so we broke up (it was my fault for the most part). After we broke up, I was depressed for a few months- no suicidal thoughts by then, but after a few months later it started to happen again. All those thought came crashing into my mind again, and this time some of my past locked off childhood trauma came back along with it. This is not her fault, infact I thank her for keeping me alive, and being there for me. All I wish is that she lives a happy life and gets a happily ever after....Anyways, now that I have told you about my suicidal thoughts  (even tho this ain't the full story...), I now want to tell you how I cope with my suicidal thoughts and trying to prevent myself from going to the edge.

1. I listen to sad vocaloid music. They have meaningful and relatable lyrics and gorgeous visuals!
2. I imagine scenarios where I kill myself. successfully, and a future of the effects of my death that has had on people who ""Care"" about me... (still working on that)
3. Cry, remember point 1? Listen to the music, now remember point 2? Do both at once and then follow point 3... Cry your heart out.
4. Keep shouting at your pillow and pretend those are your inner demons (it's not that effective but it's worth a try)
5. Go to a peaceful area in your city or island and just chill there.
6. After doing all those things, what I like to do is listen to positive or childhood nostalgic songs that keep my spirits high and going for a good while! This is particularly helpful when you do all the above points, and especially should be doing when your doing point 5. 


Thank you, for reading this, I hope this has been helpful even if it is just on a microscopic level. I hope to meet you all one day and be friends( ^_^)

"Some problems can’t be talked out of.I reached the end a few years ago. I’ve been hanging out and waiting for the courage to kill myself but I’ve never been able to even in the most intense periods of pain. I wish I was stronger. There have been so many moments in my life where I wanted to kill myself but didn’t, and I’m looking back and wishing I had the strength then to just get it done with. Life has been very negative as long as I can remember and once puberty hit and it became obvious where I was in the hierarchy life has been bleaker than bleak. It took me a while to realize it, everyone says I need to love myself but my entire life has been a drawn out process of losing any self-love through the realization that I’m a failure of a human being. My body could not be much worse, like literally if you listed what not to include in a human body of my gender you would have a description of me. And people do care about that, they think I’m mentally disabled or an idiot, and maybe I am. My entire life has been the slow realization that seeing myself positively is a lie, you don’t forget that smug smirk in another person’s face, especially once you’ve seen it hundreds if not thousands of times.

There is nothing to look forward to, the only things I wanted and looked forward to are apparently too difficult for me to achieve, things like physical love and being touched positively. How sad is that?  There are teenagers more accomplished than me in junior high, and all the abstract things like degrees don’t matter compared to the basic facts of life.

The fact is I was born a loser and I will die a loser and every time I’ve tried to change that has been a humiliating experience of being put in my place. My family has blown me off for decades and my friends stole from me and talk shit, so I don’t really have any friends. I’ve never experienced love, and for a long time, that was what kept me going. And I did everything in the name of being good enough, but the truth is that being good enough has NOTHING to do with being good enough.

I lived 22 years of absolute misery before I met her, she was the only person who gave me hope and real happiness. I've been content at times being alone, but not now after this. She's even said that we'll meet again some time a year or so from now, and I know I have a chance to get her back, but that's so far away and things may change between now and then. 

I've never wept so much in my life, I went to the hospital but I was released right away. They don't hug you at the hospital anyways. 

I haven't mentioned that our relationship was long distance and we had only spent a week together about a year ago. That was the best time of my life and if I could live one moment over and over again it would be meeting her for the first time. 

All I can think about is suicide but that's all it'l come to, I know I don't have what it takes to do anything. However, I haven't eaten in two days. I have refrained from drinking alcohol aswell, which I know would make me feel better but at the same time it wouldn't.

I've spent a few hours looking for someone to talk to on omegle and met a couple of people who I had a decent conversation with.

I know this isn't exactly a place to meet people, but I know the people who read these posts care very much for others and i'd like to know one or two of you. If anyone is willing to skype with me i'd appreciate it more than I could put into words. She was my only friend on skype and nothing was better than hanging out for an hour or so and shooting the shit with her (other than actually being with her IRL). 

I know its hard to care about strangers, but I need someone to talk to who will eventually get to know me and just let me know that they care. I'm 25 and I have no family to turn to, just an in-affectionate cat who won't even sit on my lap.

"Thinking about suicide... recalling sexual abuse... I think...A few days ago, I was working on a timeline of nodal events in my life with a psychologist. Some of the events were tough but I could vocally talk about them as I wrote them down. Then I recalled an event. I'm currently 27 (male), and this happened when I was around 20 or so. 

I met this guy online. We chatted a bit and finally met. He picked me up, and we went for coffee. Then I decided that we should hang out at my place. He seemed alright and normal. We were just talking, and he kept trying to move the conversation to sex. I told him that I didn't want to do that. He started to put me down and tried to talk me into it (I can't remember what he said but I felt guilty and like I owed him something). This went on for what seemed like hours. He wouldn't leave my apartment. He was blocking the entrance. I felt trapped, all while he continued his verbal manipulation. I don't know remember how we ended-up in bed or how my clothes were off. I remember him touching my genital area and him making me touch his. It felt so wrong. I remember panicking. I remember more verbal abuse. I remember feeling terrible...like it was my fault... and I remember the relief when he finally left and I locked the door. 

I've blocked this event out, not thinking about it much until I thought about it in my therapy session. I told the psychologist that I couldn't tell her but I would write it down for next time. When I drove home after the session, I broke down, cried, felt a lot of anxiety. Just parked on the side of a country road, all in the dark.  Was this sexual abuse? Was it my fault? I'm not sure what it was. I'm thinking about suicide. I have a plan, bought the means to go through with it, and visited the place where I want to do it. What is wrong with me? ",2.0

"Price of my DeathOn monday I am going to tell my therapist I am going to kill myself on my birthday on August 18th. I am afriad he may try to hospitalize me, I have no health insurance and not enough money to pay for any hospital costs. Should I just not show up, and email him with some excuse. To be completely honest he is the only human being in the world that I have ever trusted, even though I lie all the time; I want him to know why, how, when, etc. Either not show up or risk hospitalization, I cannot pay nor let anyone at work know I want to kill myself since he his a work supplied therapist they will all know.

If I tell him and he hospitalizes me I will just kill myself when I am released, I already have everything set up.",2.0

"What are you supposed to do when you're tired of talking?I've been suicidal ever since the time I almost attempted in 2006.  Anyone who's lived with this knows what it's like.  It feels like being an alcoholic but instead ideations of self harm are the drug I can't escape.

im self aware enough to know it's important to talk to someone when you're like this, so I do.  I talk to friends and loved ones who have a hard time understanding what I'm feeling but they mean well.  But increasingly when I get in a bad way I get less hesitant to talk with people.  It's like I've rung that bell too many times.  I'm afraid I'm just wearing them down with my negativity and soon anyone who cares will run away from me.  I wouldn't blame them.

So now here I am wanting to kill myself, felling like its a lot less of a matter of if but rather when, and I'm tired of talking.  I'm tired of looking for a sympathetic ear or a shoulder to cry on.  I feel like anything I could say has already been said.  Everyone's seen this episode a billion times and it's played out.

I've tried to get another job.  I've tried dating.  I've done everything in my power to fix things.

My life revolves around working my awful job to pay my loans.  Taking shit from my parents, and being a joke to my family.  They literally make fun of me to my face for having a useless degree and so much debt.

I am tired of working for absolutely no reason other than to pay off my student loans...  I know lots of people have student loan debt, but I was lied to by my parents.  They said they'd pitch in.  Now they laugh at my debt.  FUCK THEM!!!!!!!!!

Just writing some of my thoughts outI’m still suicidal but kinda on the fence if I can actually build up the courage to do it. I want this pain to end but I’m afraid to do it myself. I know A part of me wants to live but the other part wonders if it’s worth it. I’ve been sick to my stomach lately and not sure if it’s the depression or anxiety or both. My chest always feels faint and I have no energy. Early this morning I went to the ER to get staples put in for more self harm. I was sent home after the staples were put in. I’m starting to wonder if I’m safe to be on my own right now or do I need to be in hospital. I haven’t been admitted on a psych unit in about a year. I feel like I’m at the end of my being and nothing is left of the person I was. I see my family doctor tomorrow and hopefully get a medical not to quit my job (a lot of people don’t agree that I should do that but I just can’t do it). I want to get better and I don’t think I can adjust my meds anymore I basically just have to wait whatever this is out. What is one supposed to do when they have come to nothing left inside and have a death wish. My self harm is “non suicidal” but is problematic enough that it could “accidentally” lead to death and I don’t think I’d care if it did. I just know I’m in a living hell and don’t know what to do with myself anymore.,2.0

"I don't want to try anymore.I sometimes read people write here that life is shit and won't get better (I feel the same) and then I see someone's comment like ""But people still stay coz what if they find their love tomorrow!"" Jesus... Are you out if your fucking mind? Doesn't it occure to people who post this kind of comment that probably this person really doesn't even hope for it anymore and maybe that's the reason why they want to die? No. No one will meet their true love the next day they decided not to end life. We are not in the fucking movie. I sometimes think that love doesn't exist for everyone.

Most of people are lonely. Some people die when they are old without even experiencing love. I am taking about romantic love. When people tell me that there is also love of friends, parents.i want to tell them to cut the bullshit. Seriously, I can't keep listening to this bullshit anymore. Everyone of us knows that we all are taking about romantic love. This is what we all want (maybe very small percentage doesn't want it, most if us want this thing). But you know what, I have heard this shit like ""What if you need your love tomorrow"" for all my life and guess what? Didn't happen. I chose to bare this shitty life, this pathetic existence that makes no sense to me just because of stupid hope. I could have finished all this shit years ago. 

If there was a true love it wasn't mutual. And no, nothing else makes me happy coz without love I don't care how much money I make, what kind of good I eat, if I have a home or rent a room with bunch of other people coz honestly to me all this shit doesn't matter if I live this life without having only one thing I have ever wanted. Why the fuck do I need the life without it? I had one, but I lost it. Fuck all of this,life, people, responsibilities. Some people will never forgive me for ending my life but it's not as bad as to live one day at a time and having thoughts about how pointless everything is.

I feel dead inside, my life has not been the greatest(family/daddy issues lets call it), ever since I was a kid I've been kind of depressed but I kind of just got use to feeling that way.

But lately, specially in the last two years I feel like I lost myself, I just simply don't enjoy anything, I don't feel like a human being anymore, I feel so shitty and miserable that I don't feel nothing at all.

I'm 24, I see the people around me getting awesome.jobs, getting married,having kids,degrees, with everything figured out and I'm just stuck on my shitty call center job.

I try so hard to have a decent life, but I feel like everything is falling apart, I had to stop going to college because I can't really afford it, and I need to get an education because I do not want to work.on a call center all my life.

I live with my boyfriend and we have a great relationship but he is one of those people that believe that you can just stop feeling depressed and anxious like you have a switch in your brain or something....

I am lost, I have no one to talk to, I can't afford a therapist (and on the country where I live no one gives a damn about mental health) and I've started to feel suicidal because life is just too damn hard..

I don't want to kill myself, but I feel like I'm loosing my mind and I'm afraid one of these days I'm going to just snap and drink poison or jump in front of a car...

"Suicide helpHey everyone, please no hate.

I’ll try to keep this as short as I can since it could be so long.

Several times within the last few years my brother and sister have separately let me know they have been contemplating suicide. It has gotten much worse lately. Both of them have screamed and yelled at me wishing they weren’t alive during conversations where they have confided in me and not liked my response on how to help them. Honestly I struggle with these feelings myself but feel that I would never follow through. We grew up with an agoraphobic mother who also has her own struggles and has threatened suicide to us on multiple occasions. I am 27, my brother is 30 and my sister is 25.

I’m making this post because tonight it got out of hand. Both my siblings are going through severe times. I met with both of them at separate times today due to their plea. I believe I was able to help my brother feel better for now. My sister however drove away in a roar of pain and madness after i tried talking to her.

 I’d love some advice on how to help my siblings. I have assisted them both through counseling in the past years.

"Daughter wants to end it all in few weeksI don't know what to do. My daughter is 22 and she is talking about ending it all in a few weeks if she can't find a reason to live. I told her I could have her committed but that is the last resort. She is currently in college, set to graduate in May and she doesn't want to talk to a psychiatrist or psychologist due to losing her ability to get her  license for a job. 

Her life has been up and down. She makes friends, then they come and go. Which I told her that is normal, people will always go and go in your life. She just recently found out her boyfriend of a year has been cheating on her with a girl he had been dating for 3 yrs. Apparently this boy and my daughter had been making plans for the future and wham she finds out it's all been a lie.

The virus has impacted her life tremendously due to fact she isn't socializing like she was (conventions, hanging out with friends etc) so it's messing with her mental state. She doesn't see a future cause at the moment nothing makes her happy and she aches all over. She musters through the day but once it's over she breaks down and says what is the point of living. I tell her you make life for what it is, good bad, high low, you make your own happiness but that is what a parent would say . She is only 22 and can have a full life ahead of her but she doesn't want it. 

I do not know what to do and where to turn. I feel if I have her committed for self harm she will hate me  forever. I love her deeply since she is my only child but I don't want to lose my kid!  Any advice to what to say to her is deeply appreciated!",2.0

I’ve been intensely depressed lately, it hurts physically to be alive- i wake up and go to sleep crying. Anyway so yesterday I went to drink on the park with some friends and I drank far too much, hoping it would make me happy or numb. It did for a bit but on the way home, I got off the train in the middle of nowhere, sat in a park and had a mental breakdown. I mean, properly sobbing- i called Samaritans hoping they’d be able to tell me why i’m suicidal even when i’m happy, but they were utterly useless and only responded with “mmm...mmm...that must be hard.” So i hung up and cried for an hour or so on the random park before heading back to the train station and god i wanted to chuck myself over the tracks so badly. So badly. I was too pussy to do it though. I got on the train and cried all the way home and couldn’t think about anything other than killing myself.

But i still firmly follow it.

My family is religious so i feel like they would change their attitude towards me if i came out and i feel like if i do come out and they show any other emotion other than acceptance I'll start begging them to kill me or just kill myself.

 I feel like I'm never meant to be happy. Forever lonely putting on a mask to prevent people from coming in.  Its not like I'm never happy... it's just that most times when i feel happy its only temporary and its only a matter of time before i break down again. and then there's college and studies being there to bash me down further. I can't bring myself to start studying and that makes me scared that i will turn into a failure.

I feel like coming out might fix my suicidal urges but there's an equal chance that it might lead to me killing myself...i want to leave this country and be alone but i also love my family too much to leave...and leaving will still only be possible if i can force myself through college and university and actually be able to earn for myself.",2.0

"I don't want to die.But I want to live even less...

I'm 16 years old and about four months ago, I was happily going about life in an optimistic fashion; lots of hopes and dreams and ideas. I really enjoyed life. Now I want to die.

One day, I noticed an unusual feeling in the back of my head and was having a little bit more trouble remembering things. I didn't think much of it, though, and kept living my life assuming I was just under a lot of stress from finals. But even when summer came, it never went away. A month and a half later, I was in my final week of summer camp having a blast, when all of the sudden the feeling got so much worse and started switching sides. I also noticed that I was having a lot of trouble thinking/remembering/speaking to people. It was like I was in a brain fog.

Of course I was worried, so I went home and started going to doctors. Fast forward to 3 months and 80 zillion doctors later: I still don't know what the fuck is wrong with me. I walk through everyday lost and confused and barely able to hold onto my own thoughts and forget having a meaningful conversation. 

Life just isn't worth living anymore. Everyday is like torture and the only reason I'm even alive right now is because I'm holding on to a small piece of hope that maybe I'll return to my old self. I'm not very hopeful though, and I'm not really sure why I'm posting here. I really don't want to die, I want to live a fulfilling life. Ugh...

EDIT: Just got results back from neuropsychologist and there genuinely is something wrong with me. While this sucks I'm glad that I finally feel validated. Maybe the neurologists that all diagnosed me with anxiety will finally believe me that something's wrong. Still holding on, but still feeling suicidal... :(",2.0

I try to act like I cut ties in seconds and that I never get attached but truth is I miss everyone whoever exited my life or exited a certain status like a romantic relationship. For some amount of years I was hesitant to call anyone a best friend because of how one turned out to be and how they left my life without even looking back at me. I hate that I have to confess to someone online to get actual help and I hate how I just threw somethings at the same time making it look like I'm miserable 24/7 but truth is I just feel miserable for like 1 day out of 3 and in the 2 left I usually ignore it by surrounding myself with friends.

"I'm posting this here because /r/Drugs said they didn't want to deal with my dirty laundry.As a hook just so people don't tl;dr I regularly take 15,000mg of paracetamol in my chasing of being high

Hello. Hope you can help.

I am a UK 25 year old male with anxiety/depression issues which obviously feed my problem. I'm not addicted (physically) to anything other than tobacco. My problem is I am addicted to getting high. Weed, alcohol, my prescription medication and the devil CO-CODAMOL.

I just eat whole 30 box 13/500 co-codamol on a regular basis. I know it's harmful, hell I'm a chemistry graduate and I know I can do cold water extraction and make it safer but I don't care this is effectively para-suicidal behaviour. I want help. In fact I told the doctor and they just stopped prescribing it to me. Now I just buy it. Don't get me wrong this is not a physical addiction I might do this twice a week have a few weeks off and do it again yet that doesn't down play the damage of this, I know this is killing me.
If I'm to be ruthlessly honest, I'm not ready to stop being high. I want to stop damaging my body so much. It would be safer for me to be doing heroin compared to what I am doing now. I feel I am stuck between a rock and a hard place because frankly I don't want to get clean. I just want to be practising my substance abuse with as little harm as possible whilst making my para-suicidal behaviour so easy (e.g. ""Well these 30 tabs will give me a neat buzz and I might as well not wash the paracetamol out anyway because I don't care if I die the majority of the time"") .

I very much use drugs to blur out the intrusive thought of my life sucks and I can find solace in being high. I don't even want to be sober I just want to not kill myself which I know I'm going to do.",2.0

I'm 26 In  a few months and I barely have any friends, the ones I do I rarely ever get to see. I got fired a month ago because I blew up on management for the constant shitty treatment they gave me every day and so they kicked me out and banned me from the property and since then I havent found a full time job no matter how hard I try. I never had a proper girlfriend so I dont even know what it's like to hold hands with a female while other people my age i went to school with have went to college, found great jobs, and started a family. My health has also deteriorated as I have untreated obstructive sleep apnea so I cant breathe for shit when I try to sleep so I'm constantly tired even if I sleep for 12 hours(usually consists of me waking up briefly every 2 or so hours). I cant fucking afford the machine to help because my moms insurance doesnt cover it all (cant even afford my own health insurance or car insurance I have to rely on my mom for everything because of how much a failure I am). I have severe social anxiety so anything I try to do that involves going somewhere or doing something new I get so nervous and freak out I usually just go back home and sit in my room. The last time I truly remember being happy was when I was a kid. Its only gone downhill since I graduated high school 8 years ago. The only thing that even makes me slightly smile anymore is my dog, but with her health (over weight blind diabetic and being a pug has respiratory issues) she wont be around forever since she has all that and is already 10.

"Need to ventSuicidal thoughts aren't new to me. When I was younger and I would face any kind of real hardship the thoughts would creep in. I would think about family and friends and how their life would change and I would be immediately snapped out of the fantasy of death. As the years went by I kept the self destruct button locked away, only to be brought out in times of true duress. 2 years ago I made my first attempt. Actually it was more of an attempt at an attempt. I sat in my bath tub after using a razor to scratch into my arms and thighs. I was never brave enough to do deep damage. I contemplated and contemplated while the water turned cold. I looked over at my hair dryer and the thoughts set in. The cord was long enough to dip in the water and I eventually let in drop in. Obviously it did not work. I had not known that hair dryers these days were made different now so they weren't effective in suicide attempts. Since that moment I've been scared. Scared that I actually had the strength to allow myself to die. Currently I feel as though I'm at a low I've never been to before. I've had depressive episodes before but they were few and far between. It would just feel like I was not comfortable and it was manifesting in a 'gaping hole' feeling in the pit of my stomach. I just felt empty. It didn't last long but this one has. I've taken to distracting myself with drugs alcohol tv and friends but each day it feels like it works less and less. I try not to be one of the people that only look at the negative but I've spent a lot of time thinking about each aspect of my life and finding that I am discontent with each and every single one. I've kept myself alive all this time because I was able to find one thing, at least one thing, worth living for. Now I try and I just feel apathetic. The odds are stacking up against me and my pretty little self destruct button is looking a lot better by the passing day. I'm scared of tomorrow. So scared that I'm considering ending today. ",2.0

Things started getting a bit better about 5 years ago, with the right combination of medication, therapy, and a lovely woman, who I fell in love with and married. I have been very stable for a long time.

The past two years have seen my Father's rapid decline into Early onset Alzhemiers, my Mothers Cancer coming back (Resulting in her being on her deathbed as we speak with almost no time left.) My dreams of completing my education going up in flames, A severe car accident which left me with a really messed up back and right leg which cause me to be in pain most of the day, my financial situation going from bad to worse, my parents going through a really rough time with their money due to some really bad people taking extreme advantage of them while Mom is dying, My oldest son coming to live with us and having major issues of his own... the list goes on, and Im not trying to sound like a complainer or whiner, but I just cannot take it much longer. 

I know that there are plenty of people who have it even worse than me, and I feel guilty for feeling this stressed over my problems, but I have tried and tried to make the best of all of these situations, only to have more and more piled on me.

"The only thing keeping me from ending it is knowing that I would fuck up my family's livesEvery day I wake up and go to work and then make myself some hope that there may be happiness for me in the future just to come home and get overwhelmed by the feeling of hating myself and wanting to die. The past months I've been trying to get out of this. I've worked my ass off and did things to make me feel good about myself (eating healthy, working out, socializing again, working towards goals) just to fall in even bigger of a hole. I wish I could give y'all an inside of my mind so you could see the mental barriers I have that keep me from opening up to anyone. I'm a burden in most people's lives. I don't even answer texts of my loved ones anymore. I feel awful about myself and hate that I have to be the way I am. I fucked my entire life and knowing that i have to do this for maybe 60 more years just hurts so much. My life only causes pain but I know that my death would cause even more pain.

Maybe i'll call my parent's, just to tell them i Love them or some bullshit cliche.

"One of my close friends is more suicidal than usual lately and the only thing I can think of to help him involves me threatening to leave him and I think it would be too hard on him right now. What do I do?One of my close friends is more suicidal than usual lately and the only thing I can think of to help him involves me threatening to leave him and I think it would be too hard on him right now. What do I do?

So basically my friend has pretty bad depression/bpd and he’s tried to kill himself before but thankfully he has terrible luck when it comes to that. Recently I thought he actually managed to do it when I didn’t hear from him for two weeks but it turns out he’d been in the hospital after a pretty bad one. Now, tonight, he disappeared again, and although I’m devastatedly worried, he’ll probably be fine, and he also lives in another country so I can’t reach him myself or even call the police. (it’s only been a few hours and maybe just went to sleep early, I’m worried but he’ll probably be ok, though I’m very open to suggestions on things I can do to make sure he is)

But the problem is what I should do when he gets back. You see, most of his troubles lately have been from a toxic relationship he’s in right now, but he can’t stop himself from seeing this guy because he craves the attention so bad. I’ve tried talking him out of it, telling him I’d do anything for him to stop seeing this guy but it’s useless because even he knows the relationship is toxic. The only idea I have left is to say that if he doesn’t break up with this guy, I can’t talk to him anymore. At first I thought it was exclusively for his benefit but when I thought about it, I can’t keep thinking he’s dead every couple of weeks and keep my mental health. If I can stand my ground on this, I’m almost certain it’ll be enough since we’re pretty close. But I also don’t want it too be too much for him, and have him die for real because of something I did. Is there something else I can do, or do I have to risk it?",2.0

I don't want to tell people.

I can't let them find out.

I want to kill myself, I haven't figured it out yet, but when I do I don't want to be blocked and have people making sure I don't kill myself.

Also if anyone finds out about any small part of my problems, the entire web of lies that make up my ""personality"" would just crumble. They would know everything. I'm horrible I hate myself.

But it doesn't matter what I think about myself. Nothing matters. There is no point to anything. Everything's fake. Things that aren't fake still don't matter. There's no escape from chaos. All of us are just jumbled up particles reacting with each other and free will is just an illusion. Shit I did it again. Stop it

I want to stop thinking. I want to stop everything. I need it all to stop.

But I don't see any way out other than death.

But I don't want to try because I might mess up. Then everyone would know, and I might be paralyzed or injured. Then I would want it more. But it would be worse because I wouldn't be able to try again.

I can't talk to someone. It would ruin everything. But I don't know how to kill myself. I'm stuck. I just want to stop existing.

I'm trapped in my head. People say these feelings aren't a part of me, but then what is a part of me? I am in my head too. Isn't everything in my head me?

I want to stop thinking.

I can't keep doing this.

Everything looks fine on the outside. I look like I'm focused on programming something while listening to music. Nobody would ever suspect that I want to die.

It's so hard though.

"Poor choices involving school, drugs, and alcoholI've been dealing with anxiety and depression for quite a few years. Since middle school to be exact. I was able to avoid drugs and alcohol all throughout high school, but when I entered college, I stared using cannabis and alcohol several times a week. Of course because of this, my grades suffered. This led to me becoming more depressed, which caused me to use more, which caused my grades to suffer more. This vicious cycle continued on for all of freshman year and first semester of sophomore year.

Unfortunately, the first week of my second semester of sophomore year, I was caught with cannabis and alcohol in my dorm room. Campus police ransacked my room, confiscated everything, and charged me with misdemeanor possession of marijuana and alcohol. Now, I'm facing several court dates, community service, hundreds if not thousands of dollars in fines, and possibly expulsion from the university. Not only that, but if and when my parents find out, there's no way they're going to keep paying for my education or support me financially at all. 

I know many of you will think that all I have to do is complete all the things asked of me from my school and the law and to stop using, but it's more than I can handle. I'm already flunking out due to my poor choices, and now I'm going to have community service and drug education classes piled on. Also, the added weight of all the people I've let down and hurt is just too much. I physically and emotionally cannot handle the guilt and shame I've brought onto myself.

"Sexually assaulted by guy friend. I feel all alone. Please help.I was sexually assaulted by my male friend on Friday night. I told my boyfriend yesterday (Saturday). My boyfriend told me he needed time to think on Saturday but we ended up talking today (Sunday). I thought things were ok with my boyfriend and me after talking and that he would support me as I was going through this. But after we spent a couple of hours studying at the library, he told me he wasn't ready to spend time together, that he needed more time to think and that he wasn't strong enough to support me right now. 

I was already going through a lot as I recovered from being hospitalized a couple months ago for pulmonary embolism (multiple blood clots in my lungs). I'm in my third year in a PhD program and just recently found out that I lost a year of funding, and will have to finish in 5 years instead of 6 years. I had been feeling overwhelmed and turned to my friend for support since he is in my same department. But instead he took advantage of me when I was vulnerable.

I feel like my assailant took so much from me. He took away my dignity and my trust in him. He destroyed my relationship with my boyfriend. He took away my confidence in my work as a scholar. He took away the confidence that I had with my body. He took away all of my hard work recovering from depression. 

I realized today that I would have to cope with this experience for the rest of my life and I just don't think I can handle it at this point.

"I’m doneI know this is a shitty thing to post, but I don’t really fucking care.

To start, I cannot sleep for a multitude of reasons and I haven’t been able sleep easily for as long as I can remember being alive. Most of it honestly stems from a lack of ideal sleeping conditions, but I can’t seem to fix these conditions despite my best efforts. If you do not have severe sleep issues, I understand it’s hard to fathom the dramatic consequences of this. Do you know what it feels like to be severely, clinically sleep deprived for years and years? Probably not. I’m happy for you. I’m fairly certain my depression and all my other mental illnesses are aggravated by my lack of ability to sleep, but nothing I’ve tried ( I’ve tried literally everything) has fixed me. 

So. My sleep has been even worse recently and I want to kill myself; I’m really done with everything. The problem is that recently I’m literally too exhausted to even figure out the proper way to do it so I won’t fuck up. I’ve planned this a million times before, but never put it into action. I want to take care of everything before I go so it won’t be a huge bitch for everyone else, but I don’t have the energy. I need advice on how to get the energy to be able to take care of things before I end it. I’m not even mentally capable enough to feel confident I’ll be able to think of everything I need to take care of. Also - and let me make this very clear - even if it were still possible to fix my sleep and cure my mental illnesses, I still want to kill myself now. I’m done. I’ve struggled enough at this point in life in general that even if the remainder of my life is mental ecstasy, it wouldn’t even make up for the rest. I just need help on how to do this right. I don’t even know what I’m asking because most of you all aren’t going to give me suicide advice even though that’s what I really need. I need someone to help me for once with this.

"I’m 13 and I’m SuicidalUh hi, I’m 13 and I’m suicidal I really at this point just don’t care about life, I mean why care... when I was in 5th grade (so I was like 10?) my cousin commented suicide and then maybe a month or so later my uncle did the same, my mom was really fucked up (sorry for swearing) she um well has a bad drug problem my older sister was basically my mom and my grandma. My dad left when I was 3 and keep coming back just to start shit like he would say how me and my siblings were worthless and didn’t matter. My uncle than died a couple days before my birthday and so my birthday was spent at a funeral...also my siblings and my mom and step dad lived at my grandma and grandpas my ‘parents’ would always fight like boom 3 am fighting 2 pm fighting, some times it got physical but I don’t like talking about those in the summer after 5th grade I began to cut it was weird but I liked it, I hated pain but as soon as I had that dull blade it’s like I blacked out and was a different person. That went on for awhile till my sister found out and told my mom finally I stoped for a month or 2 and it went on. After Christmas My great grandma died and she was like a second mom to me like I loved her so much and at her funeral i saw her corpse...it was wierd I kinda expected her just to wake up you know? But she didn’t...umm a couple months ago I moved in with my biological dad because my mom tried to kill herself in front of me she just kept screaming about how she wants to be with her brother (my uncle) it was wierd I guess, my dad is cool I guess but he doesn’t exactly accept me being trans (FTM) I honestly don’t give a shit about living and want to die but I have birds and my sister but honestly my anti depressants are not working and all I can think about is death which is okay I guess.

Exactly what my mom wanted from me but never got because I’m ugly, have no friends, have never been in a relationship with anyone, etc. You’d think I would be the one upset over that, but I accepted it and she’s the one who’s always complained about me “dressing ugly” and not wearing makeup (when, again, I didn’t care and none of my peers cared how I dressed or what I put on my face). Due to her now having the daughter she always dreamed of and not having to settle for me, she has been increasingly treating me like absolute shit the past couple of months. Like... for example, despite my sister being on her phone easily 5x more than I am, the other day my mom yelled at me and made up some bullshit lies about how, because I got frustrated that my phone gave out on me a couple days ago and deleted a bunch of shit, I’m addicted to my phone and essentially need mental help for that (whole time I’m thinking “what I ACTUALLY need is help for my depression but you insist I’m lying about having depression, then have the gall to tell me I need to come to you with my problems”...) I told her to stop twisting shit and making up lies about me, and she has now been giving me the silent treatment for about three days. This includes her making dinner for everyone else in the family and purposefully not including me. That’s fine. Whatever. I’ve known for years how little value my life holds and she has done nothing but affirm that for the entirety of my adolescent years. What bothers me is that if I were to actually kill myself like I want to, this bitch would turn around and make it all about her and act like she’s a victim. I know she would do this bc she did the same thing when her own mother died. They barely had a relationship, yet she made herself THE focal point of that woman’s death. It was disgusting.

"recovering from a medication interaction that caused me to want to die.hey folks.

I've been dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts for months.  MONTHS.  incredibly frustrating, went and joined AA/MA and got sober because I thought my pot habit was causing it (it wasn't).   Called the suicide hotline.   Reached out for support via 7 cups of tea.    Told my housemate, my naturopath, my chiropractor, and the therapist AND psychiatric nurse practitioner I was seeing.     Things got worse when I lost my job earlier in January, and went from thinking about it to planning and finding sources for effective drugs online.

I realized this weekend that the combination birth control I had been put on around the time things got like this was causing problems with my lamictal and stopped it.    

Things are starting to get better;  i'm not shopping for nembutal, colors are brighter, I was genuinely happy on Wendsday.    I'm not up and running at full speed, but it's getting better.

I'm so angry.  This was preventable.  I missed it, I feel like a idiot for missing it, and all of the people i asked for help missed it.   I really was at risk;   I've wanted to die before, that doesn't scare me, but planning my own death isn't something I consider routine.

I'm setting in place resources to reduce this - auditioning new therapist on Tues,  seeing my ND who does psych stuff every week while this de-escalates, started the process of getting a psychiatrist from the local hospital vs a person in the community - it'll take a few months but it'll pay off.   I have started martial arts training and that really helps my mood.   i'm starting to work on getting involved in my local community and finding events and resources.

I would really appreciate thoughts on how else to deal w/ recovering from an episode like this - it frikking hurts, I'm angry and frustrated and grateful i'm not going to die, but it's not all the way done yet and I know that I have to be careful for a while.    The study I found indicated it takes a week for lamictal levels to get back to 80% of pre birth control dose, so I'm guessing 2-3 weeks for steady state, and I'm not sure how my period / regular cycle is going to interact with the lamictal.

very frustrated.  glad to be alive.    just need some thoughts on getting through this - and on what to put in place to reduce the risk of this happening again.",2.0

"What’s the use?You know, I did the therapy thing, the med thing. I finally realized that no amount of meds or talking will change a shitty life. It’s natural to be depressed in an actually depressing life.

Husband lost his (very good 32yr) job nearly two years ago. I had to go back to a (grueling) job.

Daughter (with three grand babies) moved in cause she had to (I’m her mom, never turn her away!). She contributes what she can.

29yr old son with me now, his step mom threw him out in the dead of winter two weeks before Xmas. He too has a job and helps a little. Sleeps on the couch.

We live in a two bedroom apt.

I have NO way to change any of this. There’s no extra $ to move to a bigger place. Husband stays home and babysits grandkids. He can’t just get a new job like his old one. He’d been there since he was 19, fired for cause at 52. Who is gonna look at that resume.

It’s all on me. I’m tired. I simply can’t go on like this. No amount of meds or therapy is gonna change it.

Oh yeah and I’ve now accumulated a cardiologist who says my heart is failing and I shouldn’t work 12 hour shift. He gonna support us?

And the stack of medical bills and collections from medical bill.

Seriously, what’s the point? I’m tired.",2.0

Planning to take 10 grams or 12 or more grams of ibuprofen I'm willing to take the riskHello I'm 17 I just been through hell all these years and i attempted to kill myself more than 2 times but last year I failed i just blackout this year few months back tried again but failed. But I'm willing to take  12 or 10 grams of ibuprofen to make the pain go away.  Just gonna live in the short run. I have a girlfriend she always tells me that she loves me and I do believe her but I just don't think I'm enough for her. I feel like she deserved someone better and I just hold her back from doing things I'm just a fuck up drinker and pill pop opener. and i promise her that wouldn't do any of that and so i kept the promise for 3-4 months but day by day i just grow more sadness everyday.

"Fucking attempt failed! Sigh, 1 pill every ten minutes...So it turns out when you get drunk and a take a fuckton of Ambien you just end up puking. Nothing has changed since then. Still trying to get a gun, next week is the soonest it could happen. Get high on Adderall the day before then I should have the mindset on the comedown.

Reasons are the same. Shitty love life, broken home, lost potential, isolation in suburbia, long hours of work. My inability to control my emotions led to the fuck up in education, only A was in Comp Sci. Job is the only good thing in my life.

Diagnosed throughout life with anxiety disorder, depression, aspergers syndrome and ADD, though the last one I lied about to get a double prescription of study drugs. I don't believe aspergers exists, its a fucking excuse for those who have never had to work hard on developing social skills. With the number of things I am diagnosed with, plus the alcolol and trees, I could start a fucking pharmacy.

On some Ambien right now. Don't have enough to OD. I did the math. Do have enough when combined with alcohol for a cry for help. Not even sure what help I need. A stable place to live, a girlfriend and a memory wipe of all I saw in the third world. I could do with just the first two but fuck would I like to remember Japan and not China.

I'm sick of being alive, but I'm so scared of the pain, and of giving up the one life I have. I know that might make it sound like I don't want to die, but does anybody? If I could choose between suicide and living a happy life, I'd choose the latter in a heartbeat. I don't want to be the next Leelah Alcorn, but being dead is the better of bad options. At least if I kill myself, it might ease somebody else's suffering. It might drive some trans girl or guy's parents to hate them a little less.
I don't want to live like this. I won't be attractive. Even with people who would be okay dating a trans girl, having high functioning autism makes me impossible to love or relate to. I was dealt terrible cards with life. Out of the billions of people on this planet, I had to be one of the few that can't be happy with their gender. I only get to see my counselor once a month. 
I'll be moving into school soon. Last time I was there, I thought I would be happier, being able to present how I wanted. But all it did was result in me being friendless and misgendered constantly.
I want to kill myself, but I'm scared it'll hurt. And I only get one life, and I'm scared of giving that up. I already said it, but I don't want to die- I just feel like it's better out of what few options I have.
I might just be writing this because I want attention, because maybe I'm hoping somebody can change my mind. But it doesn't get better. The longer I go without transitioning, the worse I get.

"Started writing goodbye lettersI don't know where I stand on the idea of killing myself. I've been journaling a lot recently and wrote a few pages today, which turned into me talking about suicide and eventually, a few good bye notes. I got halfway through the third when I stopped. 

I've considered suicide a few times in the last few weeks. Too much has been lost and I can't help but feel like I'm running out of time to get myself back on track. 

Anyhow, as coherent as the writing and words were, I didn't cry about it. In fact despite a somewhat persistent need to cry today, I've only shed a few tears. I thought really contemplating this would have taken more out of me, but it didn't. 

I don't know if I've changed my mind; I just know that I'm getting too desperate not to keep it in mind. 

I turned our wedding guest book...a diary of our marriage, into a series of suicide notes and an accounting of all the misery my wife's infidelity planted inside of me. So many have told me she's not worth the anguish--that I should just get a divorce. And I know she doesn't love me. Probably never did. Don't think she ever had an honest bone in her body when it came to committing to our relationship, let alone our marriage. And I was a fool. I saw and felt things. I had so many suspicions but I always made excuses. I thought I was being paranoid and not trying hard enough to be patient and trusting of my wife. And for 6 months I suffered. I suffered at home and I suffered at work. I left that job after two years because I was bringing that misery home into our life, and our happiness was more important to me. Only recently have I realized that the trouble I had at work was me bringing the misery from our marriage into the office. One source of depression fed into the other until they were indistinguishable. I chose her over comfort and income, but she couldn't even choose me once, over anything. I would have given anything for that woman but now there's nothing left to take from me; and I have nothing left to give. 

I don't know what I'll decide to do, but I have the time and opportunity to make the choice. For myself.",2.0
"Hope is a dangerous word for suicidal people.I am truly tired.i am tired of hearing “just hope for the best” “why can’t you have some hope” “hope will keep you alive” etc.

Hope has crushed my entire soul. My being. My happiness. My attitude. I use to be so positive and then things crashed down one by one because of hope. I hoped to be the person even just a few people would like. I hoped I could keep the act up. I hoped I left a positive impact on people and left them better than I found them. I hoped my PTSD would disappear. I hoped my suicidal thoughts would go away because like got better. But then, as it always does, it got much much much worse.

Now I am completely alone and hopeless once again. I’ve been abandoned, yet again. I refuse to make the best of this, this time. The one person I thought cared for me unconditionally is gone. Quarantine is making me isolate more. I’ve lost all will to live bc not only did a business deal fail and get thrown in my face after the ceo of a major company gave me “hope” but I have nothing left to offer anyone. Now I’m “hoping” my lack of sleep, excessive energy drink usage, and not eating will take me soon but if it doesn’t I will “hope” for a faster more fool proof method ASAP.",2.0

"How to make a mess from your own, perfectly fine lifeI feel like that could have been a great life, full of things that people call ""success"", full of joy and other emotions. I'm 18 and looking at my situation somebody would say that it looks perfect. I'm in last year of high school, going to study violin in Switzerland which is regarded as a great success in my country. 

And that everything means nothing to me now, just because somewhere along those ride I went too deep in philosophy. It made me feel different in many ways. I don't have similar and even acceptable views on morality, human interactions, and nearly any other aspect of social life. You could say, that most of the time my positions are well though out (though not necessarily right) but what does it all matter, if it means that it is immensely hard to find any companion for a satisfying talk? Of course it would not be a problem if there was no drive for social interactions.

And so begins my worst everyday nightmare. The fight between primal drives, and what my brain decided is rational and best for me in the long run. 

Every time I meet with friends I do this just to get my instinct satisfied. I almost never feel later that it was a time well spent. That feeling after meeting with someone is very rare, but it happens every time I get to talk about philosophy, sociology, science and other topics like that. To that I have to add my sexual drive, which especially gets me mad. It makes me run after people that I have almost nothing in common, and that could never make me truly happy, just because I haven't have sex for some time now. 

I feel sick, deprived from normal look on the world, full of expectations that I'm struggling to meet, which only drives me to more self hatred. I suffer from genetic skin desease that makes me ugly. I don't know how to talk to people on anything not-serious anymore. I hate myself for wanting any romantic relationship. I wish I was asexual.

 Because of no problems earlier in my life I don't even know if I can write here and be taken seriously with such pitiful bumps, existing really only in my head, but I just want any help, any indication of what should I do now. Continue my struggle to become a man from my imagination even though psychology says it cannot be done or what? I feel like not going this way would be a failure of the entire life.

I’ve attempted to change my personality to be a more likeable person but there’s people blocking me on Snapchat before I even add them because of what people say about me. This life is getting very tough to get through and I’m trying to fight to at least 80. You know the Earth is cruel to you when you’re nothing but nice to people but because you can’t fight back, they turn your life to ashes. Of everyone I’ve met in my entire life, I only trust 1 or 2 depending on if they’re against me that week or not.",2.0
"RockbottomEver since being diagnosed with Bipolar 1 disorder I feel like my life has slowly caved in on itself: My crush blocked me — although to be fair that’s on me, my hobbies don’t work without alcohol which I cannot have, my work which is my life’s passion I cannot do for some indeterminate amount of time, and I cannot drive until I’ve adapted to my latest medication. That last bit robbed me of the last enjoyable thing I’ve had for the time being. Now it’s just 16 hours a day of not wanting to do anything.",2.0

I've never been a kid who functions well. It just never happened. I can't talk to people without having outbursts of emotion. I'm the type to just say jokes and hope others like me, and I've lied to try and force them to like or care about me.

The fact is that I cant do it. And I don't know any other ways to do it. And it scares me. Money scares me. College scares me. The economy scares me. My fucking country scares me. My parents scare me. My friends scare me. And now I'm tired of being afraid.",2.0
"Im ready.I dont wanna die. I have a little but nice house, and an amazing wife and good family.  I've had chronic pain, caused by several medical issues for over a decade. I'm done and ready to go. 

1. Doctors fucking suck, they are smug fucking pieces of human trash that think they know better because just they have an extra piece of paper, and if you present them with hard facts contradicting them, they shut down and refuse to help in any way. 

2. Humanity fucking sucks. Everywhere you go, people are assholes, looking only out for themselves and how they can take advantage of everyone else, or tear you down so they dont have to acknowledge their own insecurities, or what they can get from you.. and only care about acquiring power or wealth. When it boils down to it, we are nothing but mammals and anything we do will never matter in the end, other than humanity will eventually destroy itself and this world. No one cares about anything other than themselves. Yeah there's good people in the world, nothing they do to help change things will ever matter either because there is FAR more bad than good. We all deserve to die and be forgotten.

3. Yeah I've got a great home life but I am in so much physical pain every day. I have been to dozens of doctors, had dozens of major surgeries, with more to come. I have no fight anymore.

4. Bad things always happen to the best people. We've all had good friends die, we all struggle, life is only suffering, what's the fucking point?? Even if you work hard, lose weight, be kind to everyone, and give everything you have to help others, it doesn't matter, you ARE no matter what you do, have needless suffering, pain of all kinds, and you will die and turn to dust. It's pointless.

I'm done with this world. I don't think I have the balls to go thru with it, but checking out is looking better and better every day. When my time comes, I will not be sad.

They are all able to go to the gym, handle their classes, and work (some working late at night and somehow operate with very little sleep). 

 Instead of studying, going to class, getting a job, or even just going to the gym, I will spend all day sitting at the computer looking at Reddit or Netflix.  Most days, I don't even shower.

"I fucked myself. AGAIN. I would kill myself right now if I could.Background: Crippling SAD which caused MDD.  Diagnosed with NOS personality disorder.  Schizoid and borderline traits.  Did therapy, 3 different SSRIs, abstained from alcohol, everything I was fucking supposed to.  Relevant username.  

Event:  Paranoid of getting identified so excuse the vagueness.  A critical opportunity arose that more then meet my expectations.  You could say it was even a dream in an otherwise desolate environment filled with few other options, all unsavory.  And I fucked it up.  I wanted to be cautious and consult with a trusted advisor before I moved forward.  This cost me the opportunity.  Didn't move fast enough. I did EVERY.FUCKING.THING.RIGHT and in turn I fucked myself.  So many ""If only I had X"" thoughts.  Yeah, I get it, the world's unfair but GOD.FUCKING.DAMN.IT this is just beyond cruel.  You take someone already on the verge of suicide, you give them an amazing opportunity, make them actually believe it's achievable, get them to power through all their demons, and then, when they are at the height of actually feeling normal (even excited), you reveal it was all a sick, evil, CRUEL joke.

Emotions: FUCKING.LIVID, Distraught, Despondent and inconsolable. 

Currently:  Drinking.  I drink the hard stuff but I guess I'm on drink number 5 maybe. Oh, forgot to add, I'm also a diagnosed alcoholic (It's now known as alcohol abuse disorder).  Grabbed some sleeping pills as well.  They help decrease tolerance, but if they happen to stop my heart, hey, even better.

Plan:  I've already formulated and prepared a plan and all of the [requirements] (https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a5yeJEkvBbU/maxresdefault.jpg) are in place.  I already planed to kill myself regardless, but this just cements the thought.  And maybe moves the timetable forward.  

Preventatives:  Suicide hurts people, this I know.  Some level of hurt is unavoidable, however in my present situation (as well as the holidays) I would cause excessive undo pain.  And then there's not having a will.  I don't want a single penny going to my narcissistic human filth parents. I had originally planned on following through in late Jan / early Feb but now, well.....fuck.  Who gives a shit.

Last:  I'm so fucking sick of this shit happening to me.  I'll even admit, some of it was my own doing, but most of it was undeserved.  I'm tired of feeling this way.  Of summoning the last bit of effort I have to get my shit together only to be raped in the ass.  I feel like life just spit in my face and told me ""omg lol jk loser, kill yourself"".

INB4:  Call anyone (cops/hospital/whatever).  I won't because 1) I have an unreasonable fear of making phone calls and 2) already been hospitalized, it was boring as fuck and did little to help me.

This happens a lot and I feel like they do it on purpose to throw it at me because I self harm (been ""clean"" for a few months now) and they always make backhanded comments. My stepfather like to say to my sister ""So you feeling suicidal now"" and she laughs and say no I would never. And things like that happen a lot.

So I can't remember what she said but my mother replied ""Anybody who killed themselves are cowards and selfish people who take the easy way out"" and everyone got so quiet and made a point too look at me and I remember feeling so small and attracted and insignificant and how much worse about myself I just instantly felt.

I’m 18/m and I’m a senior in highschool. I had a pretty rough break up with a girl about nine months ago. I’m the one who broke up with her. I realize that staying with her would cause a world of problems years down the road. Her family is psychotic and her brother and I do not get along. That’s beside the point that’s not why I am posting this.

I honestly think I have been going crazy lately. She told me over the summer that her new boyfriend was so much better than me and that I did nothing for her. I’ve been grappling with this ever since she said it to me. People always say that words can’t hurt you but I think after she said that I was in the most pain I’ve ever felt. 

I feel worthless. I’m 5’4 and I’m 18 so the odds of me finding another girl are pretty slim. After I graduate I plan to go to college and I like to meet another girl but I’m worried my height is going to become a serious problem. I’m so stressed out about this I can’t even breathe. There are some nights where I wake up and have chest pains and shortness of breath. It scares me to think that I’ll never meet someone who will actually care about me and not pretend to like the last one. She met the new kid a week after we broke up and often talked about him while we dated. 

I don’t want to end up like all the early 20s people on 4chan complaining about their lives and how they can’t get a woman. I don’t know if I’ve ever really considered suicide but I am worried that if I keep thinking like this it may end up that way down the road. That girl really messed with my head and now I feel completely worthless. I know I’m a good person and I try to do the right thing.

"I'm useless and but I can't die because my mom's a stupid bitch
My mother said that she cannot deal with 2 sick children, and as my sister has tried suicide many times, the ""suicidal pass"" in my house has already been used by her. My mom said I can do anything I want, except try to commit suicide, but isn't it my fault that I was born that way? I also wish I didn't feel like dying, but I can't do anything. I can do anything i want but the only thing i want is to die and she won't let me do that.
I also hate my mother for protecting me too much since childhood, and now I don't know how to do anything without her help, and when she dies i know I won't have the money to buy food and I will starve (which doesn't scare me much , since I also have an eating disorder and can't wait to starve and die). I never had a job and I don't even know how I would start looking for one (and I can't, because the pandemic is screwing everything up), and I actually don't really need to work because I'm in college but I hate fucking college, I hate this stupid course that I chose because I didn't have suicidal thoughts at the time i started it and I didn't know I would ever feel like this. Even if I somehow manage to graduate and get a job (I don't think I will, because I suck at everything and I don't know how to do anything), I know that I'll never be able to work as a psychologist, because I won't trust myself to treat someone with suicidal thoughts when I have them myself and I can understand exactly what the person is feeling. If I'm going to be a psychologist and I still haven't found reasons not to kill myself, I would never be a hypocrite to the point of trying to get someone else to find reasons for themselves.
I hate college and I want to quit, but I can't because it's the only thing I do, and my mom agrees that I don't need to get a job until I finish studying, but not having a job makes me feel worthless, and at the same time i don't want to be stuck in a horrible job (i don't care if it pays too little, i'm just afraid it's a job i hate). So I can't drop out of college, but I also don't believe in the shit they're teaching me and I know I won't be able to help anyone. I will never be able to function in the world like a real person, I am useless and stupid and I do not deserve to be alive, I should stop trying and really starve so people will take me seriously or at least I'll finally die.",2.0
"I turn 30 on Tuesday and I want to kill myself before thenMost people would think I have a great life. I'm married, I was medically retired from the military at an early age, and I think most people would even describe me as a happy person. However, I'm not. To be honest, I'm extremely bored of living the life I do. The most excited I get is from smoking weed and going on drug deals. I actually dream of being a drug dealer, despite having a college degree and years of military experience. I threw my $800 iPhone into the river yesterday, and immediately regretted it and started screaming and crying. What other grown man does this? The reason I was medically discharged from the military was because I developed schizoaffective disorder btw. I really just kind of want to overdose on something or hang myself, and sick as that sounds. Sorry, I reread this and it makes no sense. I'm high af. I get angry at my wife and family sometimes for being in the way of killing myself. I'm so sick. I'm honestly scared and want to get better, but also want to die. Extremely conflicted, and for some reason I have this voice in my head that keeps telling me I only have until Tuesday to make up my mind. I think I'll finally end this all and free myself.

There is currently nothing standing in my way. I’m not very open about this stuff and the only people who I talk about this to aren’t even in my own country anymore. I could do it right now and nothing is emotionally stopping me from doing so. I’ve got no tips or tricks to prolong it, I’m just merely waiting for the best convenient situation. I guess the only real thing stopping me is the fact I want to do it away from my home where my family wouldn’t have to find my body. Right now, I’m just waiting. There’s not much reason as to why, it’s more like you have to do something yet you are still just glancing at your phone, prolonging the task simply for no real reason. I have reached that point. I’ve never made a post on my condition or really ever mention it ever, and I don’t want to give my life story, but I’m finished now.

"“Who’s Natasha?”Psychiatric hospital. Sitting with my in-patient psychiatrist as she thumbed through my patient pamphlet I had filled out. She got to the question that asked me to list my triggers. 

1.	Weddings
2.	Haircuts
3.	Natasha

“Who’s Natasha,” she asked, looking up at me through her glasses. “How long of an explanation do you want?” I responded with a smile. “Short.”

I’m transgender. I was born in a male body, but felt far more comfortable with identifying as a woman. “Gender dysphoria” is the clinical term for the psychological experience someone feels when there’s an incongruence with their gender. It can be very powerful and damaging, and it can lead to depressive and suicidal thoughts. 

Weddings make me dysphoric, to see all the beautiful heteronormativity and tradition that I don’t think I’ll ever get to experience. Haircuts make me dysphoric, as they only remind me how ugly my hair is and how slowly it’s growing. Natasha makes me dysphoric too. She is the single person who makes me more dysphoric than anyone else in the world. 

I met Natasha before my transition, as a guy. Even then I felt that we were very similar in our personalities. As I transitioned I realized that she was the person I wanted to be. She was the person I was *supposed* to be. I see her life and I’m existentially envious. I see her beautiful dresses, her close friends, and her loving boyfriend. That was supposed to be *me*. That was supposed to be *my* life, but it was robbed from me when I lost the genetic coin toss in the womb. 

November 24th, 2019. A picture of herself and her friends she posted on Instagram broke me. I couldn’t take it anymore. I sobbed in bed for a while, and decided that I was going to kill myself in a few weeks, on my birthday. 

Through a fair amount of drama, I ended up in the hospital. I spent my 25th birthday committed to a psych ward. I’ve never told Natasha what she does to me. Instead I just decided to stop talking to her, as a form of self care. If I think about her too much I can get suicidal again, so I try to avoid that.

It's been 65 million years and we're still waiting for that one answer.

Human society has advanced while this has all been happening, we've lived in caves and now in massive buildings.
We're going to space, we've created artificial intelligence, we've created cars, planes and also claimed about every single piece of land on this entire planet.

We still can't get this one answer.
Is there one? I'm not sure, most likely not. 
If there was one, how dome we haven't discovered it?

Enjoyment out of something doesn't exist, it's just a complete lie.

If it is true, nothing is ever made to last.

Everything always break after a while, even our planet will.
Black holes are travelling by lightyears all the time, this very second it just has.

And when something breaks, you won't be happy.
You've been se close to that one thing over the time that you've had it, humans will eventually break, aka death.

Why should we have to experience this and just do what we think is good to avoid everything bad?

Exactly, it's a good thing.

We don't suffer bad things, when we kill ourselves, we avoid the future.
Even if something new comes, like said before, we shouldn't get attached to it too much or it will break.

Everything you like is going to lead up to a halt, and end.

It's better to not experience it.

Look around you right now, everything you see is going to fall into shambles.
Nothing is immortal.

Nothing, and I mean nothing, will stay in one piece.
You'll probably cry when you lose your mother.

She's raised you for decades, and she's the one who was willing to go throuh labor just to see you, then raise you.
It's better to just not experience the bad things in life.

Even Reddit karma doesn't do anything.

"Death wish.For at least a year now I have been wanting to die. It's not that I don't have a future, or that I don't have a present. I have it all - people that love me, talent, money, etc.

But I'm just done with life. Everything bores me. I'm 25, but I feel like I'm 80. I drink or get high to make people interesting and to enjoy my life which I wouldn't really be able to do sober. There are things that bother me, like getting a job, not having certain pleasures in life, even regret my drinking habit, but I know that it's only a matter of time and patience and things fix themselves eventually. Yet, I'm sick of chasing happiness. I'm sick of being alive, almost disgusted by how I have to strive for happiness everyday. I wonder why happiness is all that we need, in everything. I, however, like to embrace sorrow cuz it enables me to think and wonder, while in happiness I'm ignorant but then I'm tired of sorrow as well.

I'm just tired of it all.

The only escape I find from real life is in movies and video games that are often times larger than life. But now I'd like to just die. I WANT to die. It surprises my friends when they hear me talk about commiting suicide so nonchalantly. I f***ing hate the fact that I don't have a choice in the matter. Everyone around me wants to just live and don't want to give others the option to die either. Nobody gave me a choice when they forced me into this dull as f*** world.

Being the living thing that I am I fear pain so I can't even kill myself without convincing myself to go on.

"I am thinking about suicide. I care about my brother and my girlfriend very muchI have always had lots of things going on for me. I once did something really stupid almost three years ago and did a minor car insurance fraud (reported car stolen when it wasn't). I have court date coming up and the worst part is I'm a permanent resident (lived in the US for the last ten years). Everyone in my family are citizens. My whole life I remember is here in the US. I am not looking for a shoulder to cry on for my crime that I did when I was 18, the crimes I am facing possible 15 years and possible deportation. I am thinking the way is to just end it all and don't want to be anyone's responsibility. The worst part is if I get deported I don't know or remember anything from my home country but I do have family. If I don't and serve a jail term my whole life is ruined will never be able to hold a good job and I have a really good resume (worked for a fortune 500 company since I was 16 years old and make really good money) and I only have a year till I graduate and I know for sure I will be making a good salary based on my resume and experience (management has promised me a good position and are pretty keen on keeping me within the company for a while. Why did I do the crime? I was greedy and realized I bought a POS and thought the money could help me to pay for school. Now, the only reason I am thinking of going through with it, is I don't want a struggling future because of a criminal background and if I was to get deported I don't know anything of the other country. I care very deeply about my brother, he is literally my best friend and I can imagine he would be really hurt about this. Also my girlfriend who I care very much for and I am in love with her, she's perfect in every aspect (hot, intelligent). I know they would both be really devastated. I also feel bad for my parents since they literally gave up everything to move to a foreign country and they say that they did it for  my brother and I. I don't know how I am going to do it but I don't want a future of problems and depending on others because I can't make a future of my own. If this problem wasn't there I would never consider suicide and I am otherwise very happy with everything else in life. ",2.0

"I'm relatively new here, but I've seen enough for a life time of sadness. Here is a thought.I'll be brief.

Depression.

That's a taboo word these days, isn't it?

""Depressed? What do you have to be depressed about?""

It seems like everybody knows your depression better than you do, doesn't it? Which is weird. The word depression induces an awkwardness as if it's an indelible mark of shame on your reputation as a person, much akin to wearing a post-it note from your mom everywhere you go that says ""I'm glad you stopped wetting the bed."" 

It's difficult to get rid of it. It's difficult to be happy about it. It's like part of you that's unrelenting and, like cancer, could sprout up against. And you become afraid of it. Afraid that you might relapse. That you might...somehow be weak enough for it to conquer you once more. 

Personally, I'm not afraid. Rather, I embrace it. Depression to me isn't a fever that consumes me anymore, but a tickling of the ribs. It makes me laugh. **My depression** makes me laugh. Don't confuse that with your depression. I own my depression, and I'm proud to acknowledge it. Why? Because I've passed it. I've reached over to my depression, gave it a hard look, and laughed at it. As if it meant held little power. And it does hold little power. So when you talk about depression, don't forgo the thought of discussion your own. Because it's part of you. It's made you stronger. When you know extreme sadness, then happiness is bliss. And when you know bliss, there's absolutely no reason to ever get familiar with extreme sadness ever again.

So. Feel proud of your depression. Feel proud that you've conquered something to massive and internal. Feel proud to tell others that you suffered through it. And even if they don't understand in the same way that us SuicideWatchers do, feel proud that you were able to admit to it. Live through it. And come out much more stronger than you entered it. 

You're all amazing people. It's a damn fine thing that nobody goes through the same unique situation. Because when you come out, you're unique. That's right. You are unique. Cherish that though. Be proud of yourself. ",2.0

"Please help!So to start this off, it is not a goal for me to commit suicide nor do I think about it. What I'm here for is my cousin. She's been getting bullied at school and just a couple weeks ago I noticed some scars on her wrists from cutting herself. We grew up together so seeing her like this is just killing me. I've talk to her about it a she refuses to tell her parent. Although she has told her councilors at school, none of them have done anything. The problem is, this dickface guy has been saying some pretty rough stuff to her such as, ""you're a fat bitch who needs to kill herself"", ""why don't you just kill yourself?"", ""stupid fat emo bitch"", etc. the list goes on and on about the horrible things this 14 year old scumbag can say. Recently she gave me her razor so she could keep herself from cutting herself. She texted me last night going on about how she regretted giving me her razor and that she was going to kill herself. This completely broke my heart. At such a young age, I don't think she should be going through this. She's such a beautiful loving girl who is just trying to fit in.

"god i wish i was dead, why can't i die?this feeling never ends does it? after so long of fighting it i just don't want to anymore, the war of attrition, and stalemate has gone on long enough, i'm done i'm ready to cave in again. I feel the walls of my dugouts slowly turning into squishy mud and sliding down the walls and pooling around my feet. I'm clutching my gun as if it will somehow save me... but I also know that it can't, only my own two feet can do that. But I don't know where to go, or what to do anymore. I've tried therapy, and the weapons they gave me have little effect on the enemy. They only help me hold my ground and not give up my trench, but it's slowly eroding away.  

I've tried medications, but they do more harm than good, instead of my walls slowly melting, they turn more into a spasm of anxiety, and doom, with a mix of paranoia for some of them. Dieting helps, it keeps my walls from staying as puddles at my feet, it becomes solid enough to stand on, the walls still melt, but it's better to have a floor and no walls than no walls and a puddle. Exercise helps, but the rewards of it never outlast the enemy's fire. It comes too fast. Friends help me dig out my hole again and again, but it always needs digging and they get tired of it faster than i do... Family care, they try too, then give up because it's useless.

"Feeling overwhelming shameWell.. i originally made this reddit profile for this sub, but came out of the hard feelings that overwhelmed me at the time. I was a heavy drug user and hallucinations caused suicidal tendencies at the time. Ive been clean for almost 3 months now, but, things are feeling awful again. 

A little back story to why i feel as i do. A couple years ago i got divorced and since then i haven't been in my daughters life, my fault. I abandoned them. It haunts me. I tried to see my daughter back in March of this year. I went to my ex wifes house and long story short cops were called and i was arrested. Im facing 20 years in prison due to that arrest. My trial is in january. I lost my career due to my arrest and i have been out of work since march. Luckily my mother has let me stay with her. Ive lost seemingly everything that used to be my life and everyday that passes i miss my daughter more and more. I feel im going to end up in prison for a long time. Life on standby for 20 years. My kid.. older than i am now when i get released. 

I dream of my little girl, and my ex wife, a lot. Its a constant burden that's hanging over me... thinking of them, even tho they have both long forgot me. My ex wife has a restraining order on me since my arrest and its the most pain ive been in. Feeling like a piece of trash. I dont want to live a life in prison. I dont want to live a life without my little girl. I want to go back to the drugs. Right now i drown myself in alcohol and smoke weed just to feel anything other than sadness and hopelessness. Ive talked to a therapist in the past about all of this and they throw ""youre going thru a lot right now all at once, its going to be overwhelming.""

In my mind.. i know that the life i used to have will never return to me. Thats what haunts me. I just wanna hold my little girl and hear her laugh. Tuck her in at night. But i wont get that. 

I think im going to write my ex wife a letter soon, eventhough im legally restricted. But it'll give me some closure, just to let her know.

Im having to drive across country in two weeks and in my mind that would be the best time to disappear. Im scared tbh. Im ashamed i messed up my life and left my girl without her dad. Im glad this platform exists so i can get this out of my head. ",2.0

"everyone I love is goneIt's tiring. Every time I invite someone to the closest part of my heart, one way or another, they are ripped forcibly from my life completely. Some are by falling outs, some are by things I wasn't involved in, but they are all in the same at the end of the day. 

I've been thinking a lot about my ex-girlfriend whom I loved for a year, before she accused me, and carefully made sure to announce to all of our friends as well, that I both physically and emotionally abused her. I've been thinking about my former best friend -- who, during my aforementioned relationship, attempted suicide -- she had told me about her attempt to my face, after a year of being distant, and I didn't do anything in response. I just gave her the generic ""Are you okay?"" spiel and watched as she completely disappeared from my life.

I did a change of scenery, and found a new group of friends who care for me deeply. One friend, my best friend currently, was especially close to me. She did everything in her power and so much just to make sure I could sleep easy at night. We started dating, and it was going phenomenally. But, recently, she broke up with me to get back with her abusive ex-boyfriend, and she has refused to be my friend now.

It kills me to sit here and do nothing for my best friend. I've seen the tears in her eyes when she tells me of all the manipulative shit he's capable of, and I've seen her mouth unable to find words when she wants to find something good to say about him. And, I've found that none of her friends, no matter how close, have been told any positive news about him either. I'm not satisfied with sitting on my fucking hands and hope that I am wrong. But the bridge is burned and I can't do anything anymore.

I don't know how to deal with it anymore. I'm forced to fucking count the people who leave my life and be unable to do shit. I recognize it's not always my fault, perhaps it never was, but it burns to know I had the power to do more  and that I failed. I am vividly convinced that it's all in the past, but I don't know how to put it away, because I don't want to. I always want to believe there's something more I can do. But that is never the case.

I'm dying from cancer and just feel sick all the time now. My dreams of having another family and a house were never achieved. I never got to experience what it was like to be loved by a wife. All I know is negativity from my fellow human and since nature fucked me over with this defective body, then I'm ready to just end it now. 

If there is an afterlife and I meet my creator. I'm going to demand an apology. Years of being turned down for jobs that would have let me afford rent. Years of abuse from the opposite sex and decades of wondering what it would be like if my family were still alive. I spent 65% of my life severely depressed. Each day wondering what went wrong or why I was this way. No one ever to talk to. Meet a girl you're into well guess what. Open up too much and she'll give up on you and start fucking someone else you know. That always amazed me how a woman can tell you how much they care about you that evening and the next morning demand you get the hell out of their life. It also amazed me at how you could make a good friend online, on the other side of the country, and they would just vanish after a few months of talking.

I think the most reliable relationship I had was with my cat and he died of cancer too. I went into so much debt trying to save his life. He was all I had for 11 years. I'm kind of glad it worked out this way. At least I don't have to worry about where he'll end up. 

I really hated this life. It was like a sampler of what could of been but you were never allowed to sample anything for longer than a few days or maybe if you're lucky a few weeks. Everything that was what I wanted was unreliable. You could not count on anything good sticking around. Now I'm dying in debt alone. 

I guess it's fitting to end it this way. I don't know of anyone personally that could handle this if they had decided to stick around.  ",2.0

"My friend is going through a lot and it's triggered me so much I've become apatheticShe's a genuinely good person, but she has a history of suicide attempts and unhealthy emotionally manipulative relationship and a bad childhood. 
I've helped her the best i could these past 3 years, every break and suicide attempt no matter how it triggered me which honestly it almost cost me my own life just trying to save hers. She's a nurse and she hates her job,she just starting working at a A mental Ward and she exprienced burnout and had to go to the hosptial, i feel so horrible that  i turned off my Wi-Fi today specifically so i have an excuse not to talk to her and this happening made me feel like the worst friend in the world . I know it was a childish mood but she doesn't want to talk about how she feels and if i try to spark up a ""normal "" conversation once I've expressed my support and all that, she barely says anything! Just a few emojis and one word answeres. I don't know what to do, i care about her so much that i get anxious to the point where i shut down emotionally . I don't want to attempt again, im already very depressed and anxious and i just can't handle her anymore, it's  been a year and mostly her being depressed and bouts of happiness before she tries to off herself, im tired, she's 19 and im 16, that matters because i don't have any kind of understanding of jobs and shit. I need to focus on school, i need to focus on me. I could have asked for space months ago but now is  a wrong time. I don't know what to do. I want to kill myself rather than deal with this shit.",2.0

As for the pills I swallowed in a fit, I didn’t even throw them back up. I’ve been feeling a dull ache in my right side, but it could be my imagination or placebo effect. 

I’ve been sleeping an obscene amount and every time I wake up, I’m disappointed that I’m not dead.

My first college semester after a delay of two years just ended with a grand finale of a mental breakdown and missed exam which counted for 40% of the course grade. I am officially ready to end my life.

"*Major trigger warning* I find comfort in confined spaces, and can spend prolonged time in confined spaces verycomfortably. This is odd to most people, but I’ll explain why. When I was with my parents, they were super abusive. They forced me to watch animals die, and frequently changed around my room so I wasn’t familiar with it.

"Finally had the push I neededPosted a couple of hours ago about being trans and some HRT questions, since I've been doing DIY for a while and would like to take the legal route. In the heat of the moment I mentioned some suicidal feelings I've been having. Someone traced me back to social media and said a lot of really hurtful things, but I can't disagree with any of them. It made me realize how worthless and broken I am. What I wanted to fix, just being stuck in the wrong body, is this horrible thing to everyone else. Even if I were to get through all of that the waiting would've broken me to pieces first, or I would turn out ugly and end my life anyway.

There's not much to say about me, but what there is to say is everything this person belittled me with. None of it was wrong. I'm not worth anyone's time.

"I want to talk about loneliness. Please.First of all I'm not going to take my life just now. I am seeking help.

I have been forever alone ever since my 14th birthday (I'm 20 now). I do not chose to be alone, which is different from being lonely.

If I were to take my life right now I would be missed by my family and no one else. That is what bothers me. I was born with no purpose. I am not important to anyone or anything. No one will remember me. Right now I am feeding on earth' sparse resources. I am not contributing to society, but straining it. I am taking up space that other more valuable people need.

I have a brother who is the exact opposite of me personalitywise. He is 2 years younger than me, and we should be having the time of our lives now, talking about girls, cars, life and other boy-stuff. But we dont.

I wan't to live, but I dont know how to.

My parents chose not to manipulate me when I grew up, forcing me to make my own decisions. This perhaps seems to be wonderful, and I should be ashamed of not valuing such freedom. But I dont. Everything I tried to do as a kid failed. The friends I had as a kid were lost quickly. I got no advice on life. No one told me about sex, no one wanted me to be anything. My dad didn't encourage me to obtain a hobby or do sports. When I finally, with few friends, started computer-gaming, I was presented with bullying from my family. I have only few times been supported in decisions of social matter.

I am a completely normal guy. I am not handsome nor ugly.

At the moment I am a failure.

"LostI've been suicidal my entire life. I'm 27 now, and attempted to end my life back in High school. I told friends/my girlfriend at the time and they helped me through it, I talked to my parents about it and got help. For years I've had things contained, I've learned to live life. Of course there are rough patches but they've never gotten that bad.   


Lately I've been in the deepest, worst, most depressed state I've ever been. I don't know what to do in life, and I feel like everything I've worked on and gained is very rapidly slipping through my fingers. I don't want to be this toxic, awful void in my girlfriends life anymore. I'm so horrible to her sometimes, I don't know how she puts up with it. Deep in my head I hate how I talk to her, I hate how I act, but I'm so angry and upset and I hate myself so much. I don't know how to stop myself from acting so awful.   


I was just laid off from the only job I've had for 8 years. The room mates I've been incredibly close with and lived with for 5 years are done with me. I called one out for behaving insane while he was on amphetamines, and because of that he's manipulated everyone else into no longer wanting me around. By the end of April I will be homeless. My parents who are lifelong alcoholics have been admitted into rehab, and I no longer have any relationship with them. I have no drive to look for apartments, or a job, and I just want everything to be over. I'm a failure in every aspect of life, I've squandered so many opportunities. I have no money to my name, and no potential in life. I want the pain to end. I want it all to just go away. I've been told so many times that things get better, when the hell does that start? Am I just a waste of space feeling sorry for themselves? I genuinely hate the person I've become.",2.0

"Tired of causing other's painI don't know where to being... 

I for whatever reason get a kick out of being a fucking dick to everyone around me. I don't have any friends, so I just live and home with my mother and my brother. I've always for years always been rude to my mother and its been a habit now even when I dont try. She loves me the most out of anyone on this planet and what I'm doing to her isn't fair for her or my brother. 

For about a week I stopped talking to my mom (and my brother), and starting ignoring everything they did and said and just stayed in my room all day. I don't even remember why, it was something so stupid I'm sure. It started with me not talking to her and I see that got her visibly mad at frustrated with me and I don't know why I didn't stop then. I'm just so fucked up.

It started with not talking to her to slamming the door in her face every time shed try and enter my room and I'd yell at her and say a bunch of stupid smart ass shit. 

Today she told me that she had enough and in my fucked up way I had my headphones on to pretend I wasn't listening but I was. She was going to kick me out if I didn't start respecting those in this house and realizing how privileged I am. Which I know I am... I just don't show it.. Again idk why. I feel like I should have had this kind of shock when I was 7 to prevent my rudeness of being a habit like it is to her. 

She doesn't deserve this. My brother doesn't deserve this. I almost made her cry today. I'm so ashamed of what I'm doing, of what I've done in the past, I can't even look anyone straight in the eye anymore. I'm scared to apologize, I know my mother will say she forgives me but that's just her.  I know deep down there's nothing I can do to take the pain away from the years of shit I put her through and my brother. I don't think my brother will ever forgive me. And rightfully so. He's always been the good kid to my mother and I know the pain I cause on her is causing pain on him. 


I just don't feel like I'm worth living this life. I'm causing so much pain to those around me who love me, who the only ones I got. I can't do anything to take back my past and I'm scared I cant stop myself from being an idiot in my future.

During the school year, we exchanged letters every day at school that, in retrospect, sounded a lot like love letters from her part, but I chalked it up to a best friend love. I'd never been in a romantic relationship- I was 13 at that point, and didn't really know what that looked like anyway.",1.0

"I have no reason to kill myself, but I still want to.My life is fine. Good, even. Even though I took a couple years off, I'm back in school double-majoring in Physics and Math, doing well in all of my courses, and enjoying the coursework and the research that I assist with on campus. I've even found people that I can relate to in my department, which has been difficult for me in the past.

I've got parents that love me, and even though I don't see them very often because they're divorced and live in different parts of the country, I know that they love me and I love them.

I've got a retail job that I've had for several years, co-workers that I genuinely care about, and customers that know me by name and ask me how school is going, if I'm seeing anyone, etc.

I've got two roommates that I treasure. They're having a commitment ceremony in just about a month that I'm going to be officiating, and I couldn't be happier for the two of them.

And still, I want to kill myself. Not all the time, it comes and goes. Right now, for clarification, is one of those times. I'm not depressed, I don't feel any need to escape from anything, I'm not scared of what tomorrow or the next day or the next week, month, or year will bring. I just want to kill myself because I want to kill myself. I'm aware this tautology is probably not useful, but it's the only way I can express it.

Now, I'm fairly certain this is the result of some psychological issue that I should probably seek treatment for, but (1) I don't have any expertise in this field, and (2) I'm aware that self-diagnosis is not a viable tool in any case. So I suppose what this comes down to is that I'm hoping someone will recognize what it is that's going on with me and be able to point me in the right direction.

tl;dr - My life is fine, but I still want to kill myself. Help?

I was so ready that it scared me.  I posted here, asking for people to convince me not to kill myself.  And within minutes I had a few people who rushed to my rescue.  It felt so nice to be cared for.

"Screw God.I was raised to believe in God and to follow in his footsteps. I believed it my whole upbringing, and still am not sure whether or not there really is a God. But if there is, fuck him. Everyone says that he is my creator and he knows me personally and loves me like a daughter. But I could never imagine putting someone I love through the torment that is constantly in my head. If he actually is real, I don't want any part of it. My life has been hell. No matter how much I prayed and how much I obeyed, my life was still dreadful and I'm finished with it. 

It has crossed my mind that maybe, if there is a God, he made me this way so I could understand other peoples feelings and be able to help them. That makes me feel a little better about the situation because I truly do love to help people and have helped many. But why must I go through all this torment? It continues to get worse no matter how my life is going. 

I have always had huge dreams of traveling and changing peoples lives, and there is still a part of me that wants that, but I can't hold down a job, therefore, I have no money to travel. I feel so trapped.

 Also, the religion I was raised in believes that there is a life after this one and the time on this earth is so very short. Thinking about that takes away my urge to travel and try to enjoy the life that I have on this earth. I have fucked up so many other things in my life, would it really be that big of a deal if I just left this earth and went on to whatever afterlife there is, if there even is one?

I have no one in my life I can come to for anything, I literally work, go home to my apartment and sleep until I have to work again.

Like, I can talk to people at work if it's necessary otherwise I don't talk unless someone speaks to me first. I guess I'm just stubborn but it's just extremely hard for me to open up, I just don't see the point in conversing with people when I don't matter to them at the end of the day. So I basically dug myself in a hole because I refuse to open up to anyone, and left myself with nothing. I just  don't see myself in this world much longer. I really feel like I'm incapable of living. I've been through so much fucked up shit all my life  and I just really don't want to do this shit anymore.

"I'm lostHello,

I'm 24 and still have yet to graduate college. Today I left maybe the 8th or 9th part-time job I've had. I've never lasted more than a month at any job. 

This is all my fault. I fluff up my resume to seem like I'm better then I really am. The person on that resume is not me in reality. I'm a mess. I can't handle my emotions. I'm a loser.

I'm having suicidal thoughts. I have had three attempts before. I don't think that I can put my family and friends through that pain again. A lot of times what stops me is the pain it will cause. I also can't do that to my boyfriend. I think he deserves better and I want him to be with someone who has their shit together and can at least function like a normal human being.

I want to kill myself because I have no income of my own and at this rate never will. I suck up my parents money. I'm basically just existing, and have been doing that the past four years. I feel like I'm never really going to change. I can trick myself into believing that I have, but deep down I'm this complete failure. I had a lot of hope when I got this job and now that I've ruined yet another one I don't know where to go. A lot of this is my fault. I'm just stuck now.

I'm stuck. It would be so easy for me to kill myself if I didn't have people who care about me. I'm staying alive for them right now. I'm angry that that's the reason why I'm still alive. But I love them too much.",2.0

They discharged me from the eating disorder unit about a couple of weeks after and I have fallen into a total relapse.  Before I went to a specialist ED unit I was on a general pych for two weeks as they were worried I was going to kill myself. While it didn’t help me, it kept me safe.

I’m losing more weight then ever(I’ve lost a 1kg of weight in 5 days and thats with clothes on) and I’m getting sicker and sicker and losing more and more weight. 

I’m so depressed also. I don’t feel like I have a reason to live anymore; I just want to starve myself and lose as much weight as possible. It’s my only way of coping. Because I’m starved, it doesn’t help my depression at all

"I don’t really know what I’m waiting for.I officially graduate in a few months but I have nothing to look forward to. Deep down I know that I’m not capable of holding down a real job. I’m not really capable of anything. In the last four years I haven’t made a single friend in my life. Not one. If I can’t even get one person to like me, if I can’t even put myself out there one single time, how can I ever be someone worthy of life. 

I don’t know why I am this way but I always have been. It sucked being a little kid absolutely consumed by anxiety. But now it feels like a complete death sentence. I don’t have anything to prove, and I don’t have any anger. I just know that I can’t exist in this world the way other people can. It’s not like I experienced something terrible or was raised badly. I’m just a defective person. I always was this way and I know I won’t ever stop because it’s who I am. I don’t want to be a person who commits suicide because they want everyone to feel bad, or whatever. I just want everyone to continue as they are. It would be the exact same whether I’m dead or alive, so I might as well just remove myself from the pain while I still have some dignity, right? My only other option is just to fall further down until I become desperate. I don’t want to go out that way. 

I don’t feel bad for the people who might miss me because they are all good, normal people. They can do things like move on. And go to the store. And go to work. And talk to people. Things that just fall between my fingers. I know that life isn’t supposed to be fair and all but I don’t really care about that. I just want to do something right, for once.

"I feel choked at every corner of my life.To start it off positively, I really enjoy school and learning. I'm in my senior year of college and while I am disappointed in the lack of participation of my fellow classmates, my professors made it an enjoyable journey of curiosity, exploration and seeking. Last year however, I became an RA (resident assistant) so that I could have the opportunity to not pay for housing. It lead me to a downward spiral that I hadn't had since high school. Rampant tales of sexual harassment by upper management that the school did nothing about, I would report shit that would lay at a desk somewhere unattended. It was taking a lot of energy out of my life and my grades were definitely taking the brunt of the damage. 

This year I decided to move into an apartment and work part time while trying to go to school. I feel even more claustrophobic then before, like there is never a moment to breathe and let me rest. Every month I come this close to not being able to pay rent, leaving little money for anything else. My job is so unfulfilling that it makes me wonder what am I even trying to get out of living this tireless life of mine. I host at a restaurant, it is one of the most un-engaging jobs where the seconds seem to tick as hours or something. By the time I get home I'm too tired to do anything but lay in bed because the hours are so long and late. I'm five months out from graduating but it is literally not giving me any sort of satisfaction to have said that I graduated. I loved the pursuit of knowledge but what does that mean when the degree isn't offering anything in a particular field. And to know it was my own naivete that brought me here is so depressing. 

What is this pathetic life supposed to add up to? I don't want to be pursuing happiness, I just want to be content that things are *okay* for the smallest moment. 

This was very poorly articulated and I am frustrated I can't get all my feelings out in words so I apologize for that and the dumb length of this post.",2.0

"Female (26) Need help with my depression/chronic fatigueI’m in a very difficult place right now. I’ve struggled with depression most of my life, but currently I have pretty high suicidal ideation, and I’m worried that I could kill myself by the end of the summer if things do not improve. The main point of this post is any recommendations and support that I can get. I have a very good life with a graduate degree, a job starting at the end of the summer, a very supportive boyfriend, a good family, and great physical health. The only negatives in my life are really that I don’t have many friends (Less than 5) and my strong depression. I work out (weightlift and cardio) almost every day in an effort to combat the depression. I also eat a relatively healthy diet. I’m also on three medications for depression and ADHD (Trintellix, 20 mg; Vyvanse, 60 mg; and Abilify, 15 mg). I work in education, and last school year I’d have to go into an office and take short naps because I was just too exhausted to continue working. The primary worry right now is my exhaustion. I tend to sleep 15 or 16 hours a day without really wanting to get up and do things. I’m good at what I do, but I’m worried that my depression will make it so that I can’t effectively complete my work. I feel anxious because I want to start feeling better by the end of July by the time my new job starts. Any advice?

Not because I get mistreated or anything, I’ve been lucky to receive some truly wonderful mental health care. But being there makes me feel like I’m in prison. You have to get strip searched upon entering. I feel like there’s hardly any privacy. I feel claustrophobic and trapped. There’s not many distractions, so you’re stuck with your thoughts.

I graduated high school last year with honors and a 4.0. Life has been meaningless since than. The only desire for living my life was continuing my education. I tried to make the best of my situation by working for the past year to save for college and attend this fall. I was accepted into a small college, and everything seemed hopeful. They even helped me with 1/4 of the costs for tuition.

That is until a week a go. One of the scholarships from a private fund on which I was critically relying said that I would only receive half of what was promised. It is too late to look for scholarships that cater to my situation now.

My world has collapsed. Even if I worked for another year I wouldn't be able to pay for 1 year of college. Tuition is around $30,000 because I have to pay out-of-state tuition. 

I only live with my mother who is also undocumented and poor (cleans houses for work). She could care less about my ambitions of going to college. I can't find a job because I'm undocumented. I can't return to Mexico because I don't know anyone in Mexico and I would be homeless if I returned.

Life seems the same without school or a job. My friends have gone on to college and forgotten about me. For example, I have not spoken to anyone for the past week. I think I last told my mother I was going to my room, or something like that. We barely talk with each other. I am tired of living this way or living like this forever. I wish it could just stop.

"I'm so upset with National Suicide HotlineMy boyfriend is suicidal. We've been together for more than 10 years. Several friends of his have committed suicide including one very recently. He was injured in early December and it has been very very hard on him. He's been really angry at me the past couple days over minor things. He has a pattern of threatening suicide when he is upset. It is never a threat in terms of if you do or don't X, I'll kill myself. It is that he is so overwhelmed by emotion, typically manifesting as anger that he wants to kill himself. He just blew up at me and ranted about how I'm such a horrible person and I make everything 10000 times worse. The only tangible claim he can make against me is that I have an attitude. If I say that I will go, that doesn't change anything. He just told me that he thinks about killing himself, researches it, plans it and just doesn't have the nerve to do it. He just left to drive around ""on icy roads and would drive into something if he had the nerve"". This isn't the first time I've heard anything like this and I don't believe it is a legitimate threat. But I know he's suffering immensely and I don't know what to do. I called National Suicide Hotline for the first time a few minutes ago and before the rep gets much information, she asks for his name.

"So I need some anonymous people to listen to my rantSooooo thank you for sorting new first of all, I’m someone who’s far in the hole. I’ve stopped caring about how people will care when I’m dead, sure they’ll be sad, Theyll mourn, they’ll cry, they’ll probably even end up with a internal dialog worse then mine, but they’ll get better. They’ve been through worse, and they’ll continue going through worse and worse things. Why’d I be different? I mean sure, I’m friends with people, I’m the first son, I’m the guy people can turn to and just let shit out and I’m the guy who’ll do everything in his power to try to fix it. But I can’t keep going feeling like I’m doing everything wrong, I can’t keep going thinking I’m letting my gf down, I can’t keep going counting the days before she starts doing shit with other people - thinking about ending it with me, I can’t deal with the heartbreak I’d feel knowing this is the happiest I’ll feel with someone and have them step on me. Do I deserve it? Sure. But do I want it? Hell no. Would I be surprised? Not even alittle. Recently I’ve been wanting to drink, I want that kick of something strong and not remember the night beforehand. I don’t want to remember half the shit that I do. Is it selfish? hell yeah. Most of what my moms told me is the reason I’m turning to a bunch of people reading through reddit at 2300 when they have a exam in the morning. (Go tf to sleep, god knows I want to.) I’m only here because I keep going back and forth on whether I want to take people with me or just goto sleep. I wish someone could hold me and make it better, but I know that’s not how that works way to well. Eating’s getting scarce, no appetite anymore. Schools suffering, (teacher deadass told me to give up xd) my motivation is gone, I don’t enjoy anything I do anymore, and I feel like I’m far too gone. Been feeling that way sense 6th grade. Uhhhhhh other then that, I just want to do enough shit that I can’t feel anything anymore. Thank you for reading, I’ll update as needed. Those of you feeling the same way, don’t follow my example, you have people who love you. I love you. Gimme a smooch 😘

"Why bother......Being transgender in bumfuck Indiana is beyond stressful. I have a great career and have none of the typical roadblocks that most transgender individuals deal with; lack of medical care, lack of funds,  overt discrimination. But still i find myself in a soul crushing depression. I see my therapist regularly but it no longer feels that it is pertinent or helping. I know the coping skills/strategies because I help clients develop them for a living. I have come to a point where I think that it's ok for me to die by suicide. I dont say commit because in my mind it isn't a crime.  MY family doesn't understand me due to transitioning. My colleagues think I'm ""weird"". My friends are distant because of the differences in socio-economic status. So realistically if I complete suicide then no one will notice that I am gone. My puppies might. They are the only ones in my life that i think are aware that  there is something massively wrong with me.  My local friends are kind of concerned but think ""She's strong; she'll pull through this"". I'm tired of being strong. I have multiple plans in my head and I dont see a reason not to go through with them. I dont feel a connection to the world. I'm not even that lonely. Being an introverted therapist gives you all of the personal connection you could want in life.  I guess I have come to the realization that my death wouldn't amount to anything in the great scheme of things. So why continue to fight a depression that keeps me from ever feeling. And yes feeling. I cant remember the last time I felt anything. I got drunk last night with the plan being to hang myself. But I ran out of alcohol before i had enough courage to do it. My friend noticed that it was weird for me to be bumming alcohol that late at night so she had me come over. I regret coming over; yes spending time was fun. But I am ready to DIE.  My life isn't worth anything to anyone. I am useless. ",2.0

"How do you get away from someone that you love but makes you unhappy and miserable?So I have this best friend I am in love with since almost three years now.

I don't want to get away from her because she is going trough a really bad time and I want to help her to get better. But being around her really makes me feel bad, because deep down I feel like she does not care at all about me. We are supposed to be best friends, I am always there when she needs someone to talk with and that kind of things.
The thing is that I am also dealing with some shit and suicidal thoughts myself and she just won't listen to me when I'm in having a bad time or need someone to listen to me. I don't think that is how friendship is supposed to work. And I can't leave because I fucking love her so much and I want her to be happy and get over her situation, but it is really making me worse. I know it's toxic, but she's the only person I trust and if I lose her then i'll be alone and that scares me so bad.

"My Dad is Depressed/Suicidal. Ready to die.I normally wouldn't ask for advice on this, but my heart is really hurting with this.. 

My dad has been depressed for a while now. Unhappy with where he is living. Unhappy with where he is in life and not being able to relax and having to be the sole provider of the house. (I currently have a job too and I help where I can, but I also have a buttload of bills and only make so much.) A few months back, he had left a job that had made him rather miserable; and pursued another job. Only to not get the job because of the insurance company learning that he was on pain medications and they didn't want to take the risk. He's been working in the same industry for years. No issues whatsoever. After this devastation and having to scramble to find a job to pay bills and make ends meet. He asked his doctor to take him off of his pain meds, they did.. and now he's in a lot of pain. The current job he has is really rough. So he's constantly having locked up shoulders and etc. (He broke his neck when I was younger, around 12. I'm 21 now.) 

Him and I've talked, he's expressed how he feels. It has made me scared for him, and how he is thinking. I can't fathom the idea of losing my dad. I know that life is inevitable and one day it will pass. I just feel like he's too young to be thinking about the end game, and that he has so much to live for. His newer wife, whom I cherish very much; has had two children with him. One being 6 and the other being 1 years old(along with an 8 year old from her previous marriage.)  Am I selfish for wanting him to be happy and to just keep on going? This is why I want to finish college.. I want to be able to pay all of his bills; and for him to be able to breath. 

Tldr: my father is suicidal, depressed and is ready to just pass on. He's unhappy with circumstances and its worrying me. I just want him to be happy. Any advice? ",2.0

I can't stop drinking or altering myself, it's the only thing that makes me feel okay, but I feel at near 28 I've lost all means of opportunity... the way my teeth look due to a lack of care, etc. I'm trying to improve now, finally, but it's too late.

Just TiredIt’s not like I want to kill myself. It’s that I’m tired of being alive. It’s just gotten progressively worse. Now I can barely focus on even the most menial task because it’s feels pointless in the scheme of things. I never do anything or go anywhere. I’m the least favourite friend. The only thing that really stops me at this point is that I don’t want anyone to have to find my body. I almost reached out to a teacher but I don’t want my parents to know what’s going on. I don’t think they’d understand and I don’t want to let them down. Sometimes I have a random good day and that makes me feel like this isn’t real. Like I’m faking.

"My mother is happy that I did not get helpRecently I was taken by police to the hospital after I called suicide hotline for intervention. They made me book an appointment with a psychiatrist and charged me for the emergency fees. For the past two weeks my mother has been nagging me to tell the psychiatrist that everything is okay and that I don't need help, otherwise they will charge a fortune and never leave me alone. She even tried to get me to admit I called the hotline as a prank. 

I went to see the psychiatrist and I could not bring myself to tell the truth. I told her everything was okay and that I was just having a bad night when I called. This is not true, I have been actively suicidal for the past year. But I couldn't say it. I couldn't even look her in the eye.

I was assessed to be of low risk so I was sent home without need for meds or another appointment. I came home and my mother asked me what happened. I told her and she was very happy with the fact that I did not tell them the truth. She is more concerned with the money, with the phone calls, with the health records. She does not care if I am feeling this way, she just wants to pretend everything is okay. But it's not.",2.0

"An update to a since deleted post I madeMade a post here Sunday of this week. I’ll recap before the update. 

I’m so deeply unhappy with my life, I see no future where I’m not just depressed. The only glue I had holding me together was the hope that this girl I’ve been talking to for over a year would like me and want to have a relationship. We went on a date on Saturday, it went really well but I’m just not sure that it can bring me enough happiness for me to not end it all anyways.

Today she let me know that while she likes hanging out with me, and is excited for our prom (we’re going together in 2 weeks), she isn’t in a place right now where she wants a relationship. At first I felt relief. I don’t have to worry about trying to not fuck up a relationship. It’s been a few hours though and I feel worse than I ever had in my life. I updated my suicide note for the first time in a year. My life is completely falling apart. My grades are going to shit. I just don’t think I can find happiness. I want to die so bad, and now I have no reason to keep holding on. I don’t blame her for what she said, she can feel how she wants, I don’t want to force her into a relationship she doesn’t want to be in. Our prom is going to suck now though. I’m just going to be an awkward mess the whole night. I don’t know what to do and the only alternative to this shitty existence that I can see is slowly becoming more and more a good idea. Rant over.

"I’ve been insensitive to depression and suicide my entire life, and I think karma is kicking my ass for it.I don’t even know where to begin. I’ve historically been a dick involving anything about depression or suicidal thoughts. I swore for so long depression wasn’t a real thing and anyone who committed suicide was a selfish prick.

Fast forward to today and I understand it all. My life is perfectly fine but I’ve been in a rut the past 2-3 years that just won’t stop. I have no reason not to be happy; I’m happily married, I have a job working within a company I love, I don’t do without anything I need, but I can’t stay happy. I don’t want to die, but I don’t care to live anymore. Going to back to the title, all of this makes me feel like a piece of shit. I don’t think I would ever kill myself because of my wife and family, but it just keeps getting worse.

I’ve struggled with alcohol the last 7ish years. The last 6 months I started smoking weed to keep from drinking thinking that might help. All it’s really done is move my dependence from one thing to the other. I just hate to be sober. I don’t drive under any influence or go to work messed up, but I practically count the minutes until I’m home to change my mindset. I’ve kind of alienated myself from friends and family the last year or so. My wife asked me to go to the doctor and I tried Zoloft with a prescription from that visit. I hated the feeling it gave so I quit after a month or so.

I’m sorry I’m rambling, but I’m sitting here awake by myself, and I have this weird feeling that is getting worse as months go by.

"Life’s interesting, isn’t it just?Hello friends, I decided to post to this sub reddit, never really posted anything about my emotional/mental thing on the internet but feel like it would help me our.

Lets start with the introduction shall we? 
Hi! 
Im 17, from the UK, bought up poor in an abusive household, which, excuse my french. Fucked me up.
I have been diagnosed with insomnia, anxiety, depression, OCD and a few other, more personal ones i don’t feel like expressing.
It has gotten so bad, i need to force myself out of my house every day due to my anxiety and my excessive OcD plan.

My story:
I was born in a relatively poor family. Dad moved away when i was 1 and have not seen him since, although i know its not really because of me, i do have a thought it was all my fault in the back of my head.
My mother met a new bloke, massive alcoholic and a angry one at that, i made the first phone call to the police at the age of 7. 
I was bullied at school, year 5 all the way to year 10, from there i got aggressive, started fighting, not concentrating on my GCSE’s. (The UK school final exams.) hanging out with those bad kids. Totally fucking my life up.
Around year 11, (age 15,16) i decided to focus on my life, and passed my GCSEs. And with my surprise made it into A levels too. 

Now we made it to modern day.

Although, education wise i am all caught up and smarter than i ever have been, as i cant leave my house 60% of the time, my school attendance is horrible, (35%) and at A level standards, i have a high chance of getting kicked from all my courses.
I now have a low chance of getting into the university of my choice, if that. And there is no chance i can keep a job without.. well. Leaving the house.
I try vent my frustration to my family, but my older sister is more mentally fucked up than i am, so i just get shadowed. I feel like im alone.
I keep thinking about my future, and to be honest. Not seeing much at all. I cant see myself beating this severe anxiety and with that hovering over me like a rain cloud, i wont be able to do anything of value. Ill be homeless! 
Not only that, but i feel like a failure, as I’m the only person in my family that was able to even pass school, and now i cant even do anything about it.
I have went searching for  councilling and have been put on a waiting list. For the past 3 months.
Every thing is not adding up, and its not looking good for me, at all. 
The only thing stopping me for ending it all is my family, and i don’t even think they would miss me.

Thanks for reading, ",2.0
"My dreams are over. I can't see how my life is going to get better, end of the line for me.I applied for a scholarship to study Biology at a university in Japan and I just got the heart-crushing news that I failed the interview and won't be getting the scholarship. I can't try for it again next year because it has an age limit.

I was really banking on this scholarship. To me, it was a ray of light and it was the only thing I was looking forward to in my life. To have that purpose, and that hope be taken away is beyond gutting.

Now I don't know what to do with my life. I have a degree in interior design from a local university, but I absolutely fucking hated it. I only studied it because of my father's behest, so I just went along with it, and it was too late when I realised that I didn't like it at all. So now the only jobs I can get is as an interior designer, but I'd rather jump off a cliff than have to work as one, and have deal with that again.

I can't study locally again and pursue what I like, because we can't afford it anymore. This was why I really wanted to get that scholarship. I spent months reading up about it and preparing for it, and in the end I get nothing. It was supposed to be my ticket to a new life, the life I was going to be happy to live.

Now I don't even have that.

I don't know how I can go on. I don't want to live the rest of my life at a job I'm going to absolutely dread, and with a failed dream always at the back of my mind. I don't think I'm going to like how my life is going to pan out, and if my failure at the scholarship is any indication of how I'll never be good enough, I don't think I want to live long enough to just experience failure and rejection over and over and over again.

I don't know what to do anymore and I don't want to even think about the future. All my friends are already applying for jobs or have started working, and whenever I see them post about it, I just get more depressed as fuck. 

I just don't want any of this anymore.",2.0

I'm in a more apathetic phase right now but sometimes the sadness seeps through the fog that clouds my thoughts. 

I've been inside of my mind for way too long, been alone for even longer. 

I look so god damn forward to dying, my single greatest desire. I don't know how long I can keep waiting for a natural death, one of these days I'll have to do it myself. 

I've lived for 20 years, and suffered for more than half of it. The fuck am i still breathing for. Hope that things get better are you kidding me. Nothing will ever be good enough to fill the void that's been created inside of me.

"I don't even know anymoreHey guys and gals. Sorry to bother you here but I've been sitting here talking to myself for the past half hour and I thought maybe it would be better if I talked to a computer and didn't look totally insane. So...yeah. I've been thinking about killing myself a lot lately. I'm not really sure why but it seems that my life is falling apart a bit. I just ended a  year long relationship (it was mutual, we had been going on for too long with neither of us getting anything) and that in and of itself was pretty hard. I feel really stressed but at the same time unmotivated to resolve any of the problems that are stressing me out. I've returned to self harm recently and I don't even know why. It doesn't make me happy or sad, it just feels like nothing. I feel like I could drop off the earth and nobody would notice. And that's a stupid thought I know but I can't help it. I recently talked a friend out of suicide so I'm trying to keep an eye on him while at the same time feeling so guilty about my suicidal thoughts. Like, if I can't control myself, how can I help my friends? I've been having weird flashbacks to my sexual assault which isn't helping matters and sometimes I think I'm going crazy. I think I'm starting to hear voices in my head, but I know it's my own voice. I know it's my voice telling me to jump into the middle of the road or self harm or anything else really. And it's also my voice telling me that killing myself is a pretty stupid idea. I think I'm going insane and that's freaking me out and I don't know what to do. Seeking professional help isn't an option at the moment and God knows if anyone will see this.

"Have a chronic, disabling illness which keeps getting worseI have schizophrenia, and because of this illness, I ended up being completely disabled. Even though I take treatment which works as intended, the treatment for schizophrenia is only made to target a small part of the symptoms of this disabling condition, without addressing most symptoms.

I've experienced a severe cognitive decline, lost my social ability, and my ability to function. I also can't experience any pleasure anymore - life seems dull and monotone, and it has lost all of its color. My emotions are gone. And to make things worse, I have a hard time speaking and making sentences (although it's not as visible when typing).

There's no treatment for these symptoms - medication only treats symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations. It doesn't treat progressive decline associated with this illness.

The illness is getting worse and worse. My mental state keeps deteriorating. 

Also, I recently demanded for my medical records to be handed out to me. I read them, and it said that when I went back to a new school after being hospitalized and treated, the school contacted the hospital saying that the students were ""disturbed"" when I joined their class, and that some even feared me.

Are there any alternatives to killing myself? Not only did I lose everything, but chances are, it will only get worse with time.

I have everything planned out already, and I'm not afraid of going through with it anymore. I chose highly fatal methods, because if I will survive, my life will be even worse - I will get hospitalized against my will for indefinite amounts of time.",2.0

"Tired of it all.Tired of waking up alone, tired of spending my day alone, tired of going to bed alone.    My depression includes the ""suicidal ideation,"" but my friends are so tired of it, nobody even responds anymore.  (I have a filtered group of people that I trust enough to tell them things like ""I want to die.""  They just ignore it at this point.)
I've always gotten the ""there's someone out there for everyone"" line, and I've always heard the little ""It's just not me, Oh, DEAR GOD, NO!"" at the end.)  I've heard every variation of ""too good a friend"" or ""I'm just not ready (for you),"" had a couple women suddenly turn gay upon meeting me, and now each rejection just adds to the Why The Fuck Are You Sticking Around pile.  It's been too big to ignore for years and now it's crushing me.
The loneliness only ends when *I* end, I get that now, and I get that everyone's been trying to tell me to leave.  At least, nobody's willing to step forward and give me any reason to stay.
I've asked in the past if anyone has a gun I can borrow.  Nobody will let me.  I'm convinced it's because everyone's enjoying the show too much.  Every year around this time, I keep thinking of getting one but it seems so much for something I'm only going to use once.

Finally this last week she brought up the fact that she is talking to another guy after specifically saying if she finds out I do that it would be over for good. So she tells me this and I’m obviously not to happy about the fact has been keeping this side piece this whole time. She had to have been doing it while she was working because when we are off she is always around me. She was always trying to catch me on my phone, which makes sense now, and she was always blaming me fore talking to other girls. I’ve been with her for almost four years and now that she is out of my life idk what to do. I have family trying to keep me up and out of this but all I want to do is drink another bottle and down more pills this time.

"Feeling hopeless, defeated, etc.Yeah, the usual bullshit. I know I'm not unique in anyway with this shit, but I figured it might help to type all of this out.

So basically I've been depressed for roughly 1o years (I'm 21). I finally started seeing a professional in October after coming out with it to my girlfriend. I started on some antidepressants and also some therapy. Things were ok, but then it bottomed out in February when I swallowed all of my antidepressants after a drunken argument with my girlfriend. I was fine, just had to spend some time in a hospital. 

So since then I'm on a new regimen of antidepressants and I've been seeing a therapist fairly regularly. It was ok in April, but May has been one giant slide downhill for me. I started by feeling a little depressed randomly, but ignored it. Now it's pretty much full-blown. I fucked up pretty badly, and my girlfriend broke up with me. I graduated from college but have no motivation to even try to look for a job. I don't see a fucking point.

I fucked up. I alienated the one person I can talk to about this stuff and that can make me feel better. I have no promising future at all. I really just don't give a fuck about anything. I feel like I'm going to commit suicide sooner or later, so it really doesn't matter if I find a job. I'm not sure when it'll happen, but everyday that goes by confirms my belief that I will do it. That I will **have** to do it.

I can't take much more of this misery that I am constantly in. I feel like there is no point in talking to any of my friends or family, as they already tried to help me so much in February. I don't think there's a point in asking for help now. I'm fairly certain that this is something that is going to last for the rest of my life. I can't stand the thought of existing in this hellhole for any longer.

Why should I?

And I feel like a whiny loser for complaining about all of this. I feel pretty disgusted by myself and my weaknesses too. 

Anyway, I've felt shitty all day. And so I was hoping to talk to my now ex-girlfriend tonight (we've been talking since we broke up). Originally she had agreed, but then she just blew me off.

I'm not really sure why I'm posting this. I guess I'm hoping for something, but I don't know what. I have a thousand more things to write about depression related, but fuck it. You get the general picture.

So that's it, reddit. I'm feeling hopeless and the one person I feel like I can talk to is gone.

But that is besides the point. The main reason I'm writing this is because of me and my sisters relationship. Today I lost my job due to my attendance being so bad from depression and anxiety, and since I'm sleeping on the couch in my sisters place she was not happy at the fact I got fired. At all.

I sat in my car and cried and cried and cried until my sister came out and told me to go to our dads for the night. Its where im at now. But the main reason why shes unintentionally driving me to suicide is the only way she knows how to react is with anger. We grew up in a violent household so anger is the only way she knows how to cope with anything. I'm the exact opposite, Im an extreme pacifist. I hate fighting. She doesnt care to fight.

I didnt ask to be born, i didnt ask for this life, my struggles, my insecurities, my thoughts, my race, yet i would go to hell for declining what i would receive. I went for help, everyone would say they cared, that they want to help. Every single one of them never fell through, i was crying out for help but no one came. I never liked the people who posted about their depression and suicidal thoughts, i always thought that they just wanted attention. I asked many personal friends for help. All ended with the same outcome, nothing. I always tried to live a life of helping others and being positive, but why does my life want to murder me after i've already died?

i wanted to be a writer; but hey! i am dogshit, i do not have the capabilities nor the potential nor the brain temperament of a great artist. if i felt confidence in that, maybe life would be worth suffering through but this... just seems like not shooting a dog in great pain. i am not religious or anything; and believe that death will be just like sleeping when you do not dream.

"So. My boyfriend cheated on me with... You guessed it. My best friendTo be honest this happened a couple months ago.

I met her on a reddit support sub over a year ago. We called each other every day, sometimes spoke for up to an hour or over. We told each other everything.

We visited her for the first time. Drove three hours there.

When i was upstairs or out smoking they blew each other. Sexual acts you get it. They tried to get me into a threesome the next day.

I found out they'd done something via a mutual friend. She cuts herself for attention because i was upset . I mean. She needs stitches. I can't exactly be angry... Ha.

We drove home. A week later she calls me and says she blew him. I hang up. He tells me every sordid detail.

I got undressed and hurt my leg. I was covered in blood. I bled and cried. He tried to leave and I told him in a sudden rage I'd kill myself if he went home. He stayed with me. We left the house and went to his. Bleeding through my clothes.

I'm still with him. It's gotten a lot better. But how can i ever trust him. How can he ever trust me.

It's starting to feel like it never happened. I'm moving on. Feeling more trusting and able to communicate. I no longer think of her every time i touch him sexually.

And that pisses me off. I shouldn't still love him. I shouldn't want him. Every time he looks at me and kisses me, tells me he loves me, holds my hand, cuddles me etc my heart melts.

And that **really fucking pisses me off**

Tbh some days i think about killing myself just because i love him yet I'm with somebody that i still suffer with niggling doubts. Some days the idea of killing myself to escape my self hatred, low self esteem and paranoia feels like the only way out.

I don't know whether to be thankful or upset that I'm moving on, and the above days are getting rarer.

There's something comforting about being tucked between rage and depression. All my life since my diagnosis at 11 years old.",2.0
"“You are not Alone...”That’s what all the mental health stickers, social media posts, and posters say about suicidal thoughts and yet everyday I walk into my apartment alone. i struggle to clean, shower, and eat. And I do it alone. 

I went to my doctor’s appointments and mental health hospitals alone too.

I am in a much better place but i did it all by myself. Ngl, comments and messages here on reddit have made me less alone than everything else in my life.

I guess what I’m trying to say is that life isn’t a
movie. No secret best friend will come and help you. If you are drowning in your own depressive mess, no one is really going to reach out to make sure you’re ok and can stay ok. Heck, even your doctor and therapist don’t really care. No one will even give you a hug.

I’m not suicidal anymore but I’m posting this to say that I did it all by myself. I was alone and I am still alone but s*it even I barely give a crap. I’m the one who exhausted every resource trying to get better. No one stayed with me to make sure I didn’t cut my wrists. I had to use duck tapes and arm bands. No one helped me with my panic attacks...i just had to hold ice in my shower. And I even learned to meditate b/c talking to myself was the only way to get through it.

I will probably relapse and I will probably feel suicidal again. If not today, it will be next week, next month, next year. Either way, this is a solitary experience and the “you are not alone...” line...its just a lie. But still, you can survive &lt;3",2.0

"ExpectationsI'm really just so so tired. I've been various degrees of suicidal since my mid-teens and it's almost always over people's expectations of me.

I've been at breaking point for years but my performance hasn't been allowed to slip. I kept writing essays and putting together presentations even when I hadn't seen other humans or the outside world for weeks and once three straight months, when I couldn't sleep over debt, when I was awake 5 times every night convinced someone was breaking in, when I was distracted trying to catch ghosts on my camera, when I was sane but breaking down from stress every night.

Now in my last year of university I have given up. I couldn't work 30 hours a week and study 50 hours a week and somehow it led to uni being the one that I dropped. When she finds out I don't know what my future will hold but it won't be good.",2.0

"Maybe life was never meant for me.I’m so tired. Just so tired of everything. I wish I could call my therapist and talk to him but I know it’s inappropriate and it’s unfair to disrupt his own life aside from our biweekly sessions. 

I’ve come to the conclusion that life was never meant for me. Growing up, I was mentally and physically abused by my dad. I was an unfavored child to my mother. I can’t make friends and keep them like my twin sister can; no matter what, I just don’t want to put in the time, energy, or resources just to be hurt by “friends.” I was sexually assaulted 3 years ago, which has torn a piece of myself that I’ve never recovered from. Oh, and I’ve come to turns with my bisexuality, but people have cut me off after finding out. 

I have a love and passion for psychology and counseling, which I’m currently in school for, but how the fuck can I help others when I struggle so much myself? How do I keep from transferring this hopelessness? I can’t. 

The icing on the cake is that I’m sleeping on my couch after being locked out of my room by my husband. I’m so tired of being abused physically, mentally, and emotionally, especially by the person who says they “love” me. I’m so tired of going through the cycles. He keeps me trapped financially and I don’t know what I would do if we split. I’m only 23 years old and I can’t imagine living another 23 years like this. I don’t want to divorce because I love him so much, but he refuses to help this marriage. 

I can’t do it all and I don’t want to do it all anymore. I wish I could take my car and drive it into the ocean. I don’t know why I have this thought, but it keeps recurring. 

I wish the universe didn’t waste its energy cultivating this life, because I don’t even want it anymore.",2.0

"Too sane for this mad mad worldRecent trauma triggered social anxiety and depression that I have suppressed for years and years, it all snowballed and crushed me completely.

My life is the epitome of pathetic. No prospects, little education, no job, leeching off of parents financially. See my social anxiety is a hindrance, it mainly reaches its max when I experience criticism, whether cronstructive or not. People tell me I take things too personally, or Im just being too arrogant thinking I am perfect and anyone that judges me is a sinner, or I need to reduce the size of my ego. Basically, I am too weak, not being able to handle such a miniscule problem given my age. 

I am convinced that people in general are all rotten to the core (incl.me) and selfishness runs through their veins. Friendships were a joke to me, was I that unlucky, being backstabbed, betrayed, used whenever I try to convince myself that there are still good guys out there. Maybe I'm just decieving myself. 

Living in a society that relies largely on social communications and interactions to thrive, I am an outcast living in the shadows. Hope like all of the people who abandoned me, cast me aside when I was at my weakest, picked me up only to push me furhter down into fear, desolation and a spiral of anxiety. 

What intrigues me is that I live everyday like its my last now, for I dont know when I could end my life; it is hanging on a thin thread, sick of all the torture, pain, humiliation thrown her way.

Seeing all these posts on Reddit makes me feel understood, like Im not hallucinating or a delusional individual always gravitating to wards negativity. In fact they confirm that I was not blinded from the truth, and the truth always disappoints.

"Could I actually be worth something?I can't really contribute to society. I'm a music education major, and while education is important, music isn't. It does nothing to further mankind into the future, it doesn't solve poverty or disease, it just sits there as a distraction from doing anything truly productive. Maybe I should just take a construction job or become a truck driver, and get out of the way for the real educators out there teaching STEM. 

Where did I go wrong?  I love science; I've wanted to be an astronaut forever. I thought I was good at math, but I just failed my last calculus test. I understand basic astronomy, but how is that gonna be helpful to anything here on Earth? There's even an argument to be made about the lack of importance of space exploration, and as much as I love space, how much does it really contribute to mankind? 

Everything I enjoy isn't important. Shouldn't I get out of the way and do something that matters, even if it isn't what I like? Should I just go even further and just end it all at that point?

Every one tells me this should be an incredibly joyful time in my life full of new possibilities. I've ruined all of that for myself. I cannot explain why because I don't know why, but I procrastinated in submitting my final grades and completing an online course for my transcript. I had a C in a Spanish 2 course my Sophomore year and decided this year to try and retake it for a better grade online as advised by my counselor. As a result, I put that grade in as an incomplete class in my initial application to colleges. I've been admitted, but haven't completed that course and I'm 98% sure it's too late to do anything about it. As some of you may know, failure to submit a final transcript results in loss of admittance. In addition, inconsistencies in a transcript can result in the same consequence. This transcript is due Monday, and I just sent my old high school counselor a pathetic email begging for help I doubt she can give me. I'm facing the loss of my future. Everything has spiraled out of my control due to my own stupidities. I want to end it. I'm a waste of space. There's no need for me here. I might as well be dead if not in college. I was going to major in biochemistry, be a doctor, and make my mom proud. Now, I'm nothing. I may as well be literally dead to her in addition to figuratively. Help me. No one can help me, and it's all because of me.

He ended up becoming a merit scholar and did his undergrad through PhD at Stanford.

Now he lives by himself. He has low self-esteem. He's very awkward. And almost afraid of interacting with other people. He recently disconnected his phone. He disconnected his wifi. He has a car but refuses to use it. He basically is disconnecting himself from society.

And just today he told me very nonchalantly that he has picked a day to kill himself. He said that he had picked a day last year but his new professorship changed his plans. He said he has less than 75 days left.

He believes he has no friends and no one cares about him. He's also started giving his money and possesions away. I tell him pretty regularly that I care about him but that doesn't seem to make a difference. He doesn't seem to want my help.

I know words won't save me. I don't think there's any way out at all. Ever. Haha. No one is born on purpose, no one belongs anywhere, everyone is gonna die. Sorry for wasting your time. That is assuming you read all that bollocks up there. Why would you do that? Go somewhere else and surround yourself with positive people. You don't need people like me bringing you down.

"I hate feeling like this!Don’t know where else to turn. Every day for weeks I’ve been contemplating ending my life. Haven’t felt this way since high school. The past 18 months have been the worst time of my life. Here’s the laundry list:

• wife told me she wanted a divorce out of the blue one morning. 
• as a result my finances have been spinning out of control and I’m currently being sued by at least one creditor. The majority of my debt (~$300K) is educational debt and filing bankruptcy wouldn’t even get rid of it. 
• I had to move back in with my parents. My mom is bi-polar and my dad is a recovering alcoholic who is prone to relapses. 
• in the past month, I’ve had to put down my dog I’ve had for 16 years without getting to say goodbye because I lost him in the divorce, my cousin passed away from cancer, and my favorite uncle died unexpectedly. 
• I have a gf and when it’s good it’s great but she’s super moody and I find myself wondering if she’s gaslighting me a lot of the time. Whenever I complain about how she’s treating me she turns it around or tells me I’m being too sensitive. Her family is AMAZING but I just never know what will set her off. At this point I’m more afraid to lose them than her. 
• I should point out that my mom hates my gf and makes my life a living hell for dating her. 

The only thing keeping me alive is my children. Otherwise I would have checked out. I’m sitting here watching them sleep as I write this and I’m just crying. They are literally all I have in this world. I’m living in constant dread that I’m suddenly going to be homeless and have even less access to my children.   

I don’t do drugs (other than occasional pot) and I have a steady job, but more than half my take home pay goes to my ex. I literally cannot get ahead. I’m on 75 Mg of sertraline and ativan as needed.  Therapy didn’t do anything for me. I work out 6 days a week and have a pretty robust social circle. Sometimes I just feel like all those great comedians who died too soon. I joke around a lot to cover for my own pain. ",2.0

I do mean it to the T when i say i have to go through her because the courts allowed her to write her own ""Parenting Plan"" so now the only time i can call my kids via cell phone is during the times they are at school or when they are in bed for the night.

I have not seen my kids in months now, i left a well paying job (which required travel that i loved) because she constantly bashed me ""for never being home"" and always throwing the kids in my face and now i have been unemployed and looking for work since Nov 21st 2018 and since have lost my license do the back child support and now I'm pretty sure my child support debt is costing me job opportunities because I've been applying to jobs that I know I'm more than qualified for and I never hear anything back. I have found a girl in this time frame that i know does love me but i can't support her financially and she has so much going for her in her life that i am nothing more than a burden on her life, career and financials.

4 years later, coming to today, my visa expires a week from now.

I  have no friends, no family, no family in my country also, no friends  there too, since i've been here so long, i have maxed out credit cards  because of my ex and i could never pay them off, bad credit score, i  have bi-polar depression and could never hold on a job for a long time -  it's why i could never pay off my credit cards and i'm to the point  where i have 100$ left.

I can't take anymore loans, because of bad credit score

I have nowhere to go back to

I can't find a job anymore,because my visa expires and getting a new one takes forever

I don't have friends,because i'm a-social and i work so much

I don't have family

The past 4 years all i did was work 70h/w and still wasn't enough to get me out of the hole

I have 100$ left

What are my options here? Get deported and go into my home country where i don't have friends,family or money?

Stay here and survive how with 100$?

I never took any government help, and now that i might need it i can't, because my visa expires?

I  have noone to call to and talk to....Why i shoulnd't kill myself and  stop being a burden for people? Why i shouldn't kill myself and stop  being so miserable wondering what to do next and what i did to deserve  this?

I always did the right thing and  tried to be fair to people and never asked for anything, just a simple  normal life....but because of my mental illness nobody wanted to deal  with me - ""Why you look so happy one moment and so sad the next? Stop  being so sad or ill fire you!!!!"" that happened way too often....I'm so  tired of life. Tired of working 70h/w and not being enough. Tired of  going to bed hungry, because i still have to pay for falling in love  with the wrong girl. Tired of never having anyone to talk to or a  shoulder to cry on. Tired of always feeling like i don't belong here.  Tired of explaining and proving to people that i pay more taxes than  they do and even if my passport doesn't say ""American"" i probably  do/help this country more than they ever did.....

"I Shouldn't Have Kept GoingI'm a high school junior, and I have clinical depression and severe anxiety along with a few disassociative episodes.

So, to kinda make a long story short, 2017 was the worst year for me by far. I lost my mother. We didn't have the best relationship. She had schizophrenia and lost all grip on reality. By the time we found her, someone ran her over on a freeway. I was also in an abusive relationship. He didn't hit me since it was LDR, but he emotionally manipulated me. Every time I didn't want to call he'd threaten to kill himself. He would get mad at me at the smallest things and blamed it on me being ""smarter."" Aside from that, the entire year was just disappointment after disappointment. I was even struggling with symptoms beforehand for years. Close call after close call, friend after friend either dropping me or relentlessly forcing me to keep going. I only started going to therapy this year, but even then, I can't see her often because my school only allows a certain amount of absences. The therapy sessions are an hour, class periods an hour and thirty.

Which, brings me to the title. With the limited resources, constant crying myself to sleep, wishing I hadn't lived this long, not wanting to tell my friends how deep I've fallen, I actually planned to kill myself December 21st. But a bit of an event involving a falling out prevented me from doing so. Long story short, my family snapped, making me snap, making me rant to a few friends who forced me to seek guidance.

I know that I probably sound pretentious as hell. I see people with more reasons than I. But it's the truth. I didn't kill myself on the 21st, so here I am almost a month later and in midterms. And I just got a truth bomb. I'm constantly worried about the future. And I was just told the chances of me actually being able to live my dreams out, working after college and finally finding peace up north, are next to zero.

Nothing feels real. And I honest to God don't want to keep going. I wish I did it. I wish I wasn't here right now honestly. I tried to find a suicide chat because it helped me tons more times in the midst of panic attacks and depressive episodes. But it's taking far too long. I've wanted to die for years now, honestly. I can't find too many reasons to keep going on. If anything, the trauma I'm carrying, I'm trying to cope with it, but I can't. I really can't.

I'm kind of rambling at this point. But right now, nothing feels real and I feel like hurting myself. I don't even know if I want to keep living, honestly. It seems pointless, honestly.",2.0

"By no way do I feel that I have anything more worse going on in my life than some of the people on this subredditI just feel extremely low. Nothing should be wrong in my life (although I haven't had the best of upbringings, and these still effect me even now). I know I've been drinking and sorts and I have no right to probably even think any of these thoughts but I really don't have anybody to talk to.

I feel as though I should be strong and the best person I should be, I've even talked my sister out of suicide when I was a teenager and now I feel like a hypocrite since I'm now just feeling to just end it. It's probably just the drink talking but I've just felt recently that I can't deal with everything in life. There's so much drama with everything. I'm always the person people know that won't be bothered by trivial stuff, I can always see the bright side. Everybody know me as the happiest person they know. But they have no idea what I'm like when I'm alone.

The only thing that has stopped me from doing anything tonight is the fact that I cannot let my little sisters (who are 8 and 10) suffer from my selfish urge to be a dick and leave them.

I wish I could stop feeling like this, the worse I feel is guilt for them for even thinking anything like it. 

I usually don't feel any emotion at all, but for some reason over the past few week it has just suddenly fell upon me with it getting worse tonight.

I just need somebody to talk to, if you know any way to get me out of this mood. But like I said, other people probably need more help than I do.",2.0

"I'm stuck in my mind and tried calling for helpI want to preface this by saying that I have a good life going for me. I'm a good looking dude,smart,fun to be around, the people that I meet generally enjoy my company. Situational wise I live with my family as I attend uni. Good school that I have a fullride to. I know there are less fortunate people out there and it makes me sad that I am in the place that I am no, I don't enjoy anything. I wake up with no drive, I stumble through the day with no energy or no care, I sometimes think that if I died right at this second it would be the same as if I was alive. I know my family and my friends would miss me but it wouldn't matter I'd be dead. 
I've tried to not feel the depression. Go to the gym, get some new hobbies but nothing is working. I've reached out for help from my family. I talked to them about my problems, but theyre a bit traditional. My dad's dad died when he was 7 and he had to carry his family out of poverty by himself so he doesn't understand what I am going through. My mom tells me that I have to have the willpower to get better, but that's the problem is that I don't have the willpower to do anything other than sleep and do nothing. I've come to their help on many occasions and they keep suggesting the same things of waking up early and going to the gym and willing myself to get out of depression. This third time however, dad told me that I need to man up and leave the house. He said I should go do whatever I wanted to do and said ""you have a car, back when I was your age I left to go work without a car. If you want to go kill yourself, go be a man and do it.""

"A poem I found that nearly perfectly describes the way I feelI’m great, fine, spectacular. In a way
I relish every night, and I live every day.
I live, I laugh, I write, I sing,
I wonder what the new days will bring.

Then I get home, and I take off the mask.
The day, and almost impossible task, 
Is finally over, and so I lie Down, 
and wait patiently for the day that I die.

I cry, I scream, I bawl, and sleep,
even though I have promises to keep.
I wait, and wonder, and cry some more, 
And I ache and burn from my very core.

Then, I’m not alone, and the mask reappears:
Out goes the grief, pain and all of the tears,
As I am a happy person, cheerful all the day.
A world full of rainbow, not one shade of grey.

Of course I’m not okay, I’m not fine,
No matter how much I seem to shine.
I don’t even know why I feel this...
Why my existence is one long, endless abyss.

But it is, and will be, so I cling to life,
As one day I might slip, and end it with a knife.
But, I’m still here, no matter what my dreams might say
And I hope that one day I will actually be okay.

"How do you care about something when you know it's ultimately pointless?I've accepted that suicide is inevitable. Life is miserable and I've tried everything to make it better. It will only get worse as I get older. I've done years of therapy and medication and programs. Life remains miserable, painful, and pointless. 

Right now I take care of my mom, who has a lot of health problems. I'm all she has. There's no one else to take care of her and we can't afford for her to be in a nursing home. She doesn't deserve to suffer the loss of child or have to be neglected. 

Basically, I'm waiting for her to die so I can kill myself. I don't know when that will be. For the time being, I have to be alive. 

I'm working on assignments for incomplete college classes. I'm finding it extremely difficult to work on or finish anything. I know that the work is pointless. I know it won't mean anything or improve my life in any way to do it. I have no desire to do it. And I'm pretty hopeless about even passing these classes even if I do the work. I've already had two professors change their mind about accepting it. I'm trying to get them to reconsider, but hopeless about that as well. If they don't accept it, I don't finish school. Financially we're totally fucked, so there's not an option to retake the classes. 

I don't have a desire to finish. I don't aspire to anything. I'm just waiting to die. Rationally, I know it would be better to finish the classes, so I could qualify for some better job opportunities. I feel like I can't find any incentive, no matter what I tell myself or what scenarios I imagine, nothing encourages or motivates or inspires me to the work. 

I'm going to be miserable no matter what I do, so why bother? I gave up on life a long time ago. I can't get myself to want anything other than death. It's why I couldn't finish these classes in the first place. 

Before I die, I do think I'd like to finish this. The trouble I've had with school has caused me a lot of pain. It's definitely a significant factor in my decision to commit suicide and feelings of hopelessness. 

That's not the right thing either though. I still don't care. ",2.0

"I can't believe I'm doing thisHey guys,

It's not a big deal, but my old suicidal feelings are back. I won't do anything. I'm not that kind of guy. But boy do I wish someone would kill me. I'm so tired all the time, I'd welcome to release. 

I don't relate to anyone these days. I dislike every single piece of art I see - music, movies, tv, even social media posts. But I'm a success. I've got friends, a girlfriend, a son, a great career. I just abhor myself and everyone else. I want to be left alone, to forget my responsibilities, to stop being so tired all the time. I just don't know how. I work out every day. I eat well. I meditate. I'm in therapy. None of it helps. I still go home every night to a bed where I don't sleep, wake up to a girlfriend I can't stand and go to a job that I hate so that I can support a son I don't love. It makes me feel like a monster, saying all of this. I've been like this for a long time now. I don't think it will ever get better, and even if it does, it will only be temporary. I won't kill myself because the people in my life deserve better. They're able to enjoy things. I don't share that, but I don't wish my state on them. I'm envious, but understanding. I'm fairly certain that I know everyone in my life better than they know me. It's lonely. So I have to endure all of this, one day at a time, until I die. It's just so damn depressing. Can anybody lend me a hand? How can I get over this? I'd like to change, but nothing has worked so far. I'm open to trying anything, but not everything. I just don't have the energy.  ",2.0

I feel alone and misunderstood, like I simply exist to keep everyone else's life in the status quo..meaning if I'm alive they don't have much to think about but if I were to end my life it would cause so much pain and chaos and that knowledge is the only thing preventing me from following through on my desire to leave this earth. My husband suffers from anxiety; I've asked him time and again to let me know when he's in the throes of it so I can either give him some space or offer tlc. He refuses to communicate that ONE simple statement and instead lashes into me telling me I'm annoying etc. Last night we had (what I thought was) a small tiff. I told him we need to put limitations on how much $ we keep giving his family bc we need to seriously start saving for our own (no kids yet). We've already given his sister $500 this month and when I say I'd like to take a vacation he tells me with what money. I have no problemas looking out for our family but boundaries have to be put in place. Instead of engaging in a rational discussion he hit below the belt telling me I spent $100 on a hair cut/waxing when I literally just put $1K to savings. And also I'm not fucking asking for a handout it's called money management and I do a damn good job of it with excellent credit. It was a low blow. Then he proceeds to tell me he can't stand me and when I asked to discuss things when he felt calmer he said NO and if I kept asking he'd get mean. All of today he's ignored me, treating me like I'm nothing seeing I'm hurt and completely dismissing it. He has blown the entire thing out of proportion to where a discussion about money has turned into a discussion of all my faults. I'm not perfect by any means but when I've made mistakes or hurt him I immediately acknowledge my wrongdoings and I DO NOT repeat them, since I firmly believe a sincere apology is reflected through action not words. I feel utterly lost and hurt and this is bringing up a lot of past pain (separate of him). I don't want to live like this anymore. I feel lost angry confused and I honestly want to disappear.

Today I'm 17 and I feel the worst I've ever felt. I practice self harm, I can't do something like drawing or singing or whatever without thinking ""you're not good enough, stop."" Overall i just dont let myself experience things and evolve in things. 

The thing is: am I making this up? Still to this day I dont desire to be happy. I'd rather relate to depressing songs than to happy songs. Its like I still have that kid in my head telling me its cool and okay to want to die, and I get confused! Am I forcing depression in my way? do I actually need help? is it worth it? And at my worst times I doubt myself, and I dont believe in my own misery.

I dont know why I think the way I do. I get frustrated all the time cause of it.

I dont know if this made any sense, but i just needed to write a bit and put it into the universe",2.0

As a result I had a total burn out. Many months ago the situation with my abuser came up between this friend and I. I explained some stuff but she said it was too overwhelming for her to hear so I never brought it up again. My response to her saying I do nothing was just explaining that I don’t tell people why I’m in this situation because it scares people. It’s often retraumatizing when I tell people and their reaction is either to get scared and shut me down or not believe me at all. Her response was that a lot of people have f’d up things they have to deal with but they still have to do stuff.,1.0

"7 DaysA last cry of help. 
Last year had a lot of ups and downs for me. The stability I always had was gone and this year has been a emotional roller coaster. 

Everything and beyond has happened. Close friends killed themselves, relatives died, I loosed friendships. In the last 12 months I can’t remember a day I could consider a good day. I’ve not been able to do things I like without worrying or leaving it for the next day. Sleep has been my only friend. I love sleeping cause it’s the only time I can come to peace with myself. I’m failing in school I can’t contentrate. Everything is a complete disaster. 

So I’ve managed to do a list of things I wish I had done the last year. And I have 7 days to complete it. I’m killing myself in 7 days. ",2.0

"I'm thinking about calling it quits for the new year. I've felt unwanted and depressed for years.That's all I want anymore. To spend some time, even if it's a little, with family or friends. Because I've been lonely for a very long time, now. Going on 20 years. And I keep trying to tell myself it'll get better. I keep trying to tell myself that I shouldn't live for other people, because fuck other people anyway. All they've ever done is treat me like garbage, abuse me, or ridicule me. That's all anyone's ever done. So why do I even want companionship? Most of the time, it just makes me feel worse because I just always end up becoming the third wheel or the last resort. It's easy to talk about plans, but once it comes time to enact them, they flake out on me.

And yet here I am..I've been depressed since November..Thinking about suicide on and off. The only friends I have are online but I no longer talk to them, because all they do is belittle my feelings.. Tell me how their *other* friend has it worse, and tell me to talk to *them* because in their minds, that's some kind of therapy. Because they somehow think, ""Oh if he talks to this person who has it worse, then they won't feel bad anymore"". I'm not going to compete with others for affection. And it's fucking disgusting, anyway. All it does is make me feel like my feelings are irrelevant and worthless. And with how much I hate myself, I feel like that anyway..So the idea that they think their bullshit is some form of therapy for me..I think I just hate them, now.

Self-love is nothing but contrived bullshit anyway. How are you supposed to love yourself if people around you have given you every reason not to. Whether it's beating you up, cheating on you, ignoring your pleas, bullying you, calling you the weird retarded quiet kid, etc..

Once I finally had the courage to try and talk to people I realised they don't talk to me the same way they talk to their friends. I am sick and tired of people making fun of my learning difficulty and treating me like I'm different. They talk to me like I am not one of them. I have been called to the principal's office multiple times and made fun of by him cause I can't read and spell as well as the other students in my class. I have had enough of this bullshit.

"Struggling HardHello everyone. Salutations, as it be.

I'll be honest; I never wanted to join or even come to this subreddit. I thought that if I did, I would be invalidating all of the progress I've made and basically admitting that I've given up. I've struggled so long on my own to get to even a slight sense of normalcy - this is kind of a last hope.

I'm struggling with a strange addiction. I'm not sure if I can even classify it as such yet, but I'm already feeling it. Long story short, I think I'm addicted to one of my meds (Bupropion) after taking more than my prescribed dose (and over the upper limit of dosing). Sometimes, all I can think about is wanting more. It's slowly killing me, but I want more. I'm afraid that tomorrow I'm just going to take all that I have from before and take it all. I don't know if it would be lethal, but I almost wish it was.

I'm alone. Making a list of friends the other day, I realized my list of close friends is exactly zero. That's mostly my fault, but I'll go into detail if someone cares.

Honestly, there's not much more I want to do right now than either drink myself into oblivion or just end it all. Does anyone have any inspiration or ideas? I'm sorry for all of this, but I can't tell this to anyone else.

I don’t want to talk about my problems while I’m there I just want to make sure I don’t kill myself. Would it be a problem if I don’t speak much? Would I be forced to stay longer than usual?

"Feels like I'm losing my mindSome time around december, I started getting depressed. I was doing super well in life, and then suddenly my progress paused and I just sort of fell into this. I started feeling sad, anxious, the whole works. Then my life started back up again, and great things happened in my life, but I'm only getting more anxious and depressed as it happens and that's affecting what's happening in my life. I got accepted into a prestigious and exclusive improv comedy group, but as I feel like I'm spiralling out of control, I can't perform anymore and I feel like I'm a burden and the group regrets accepting me. My schoolwork is getting affected and my grades are dropping because my mind is always elsewhere. Worst of all, I just can't seem to talk to people anymore and I feel like all the people/friends I have, new and old, see me as some sort of freak right now because I'm really struggling to talk and be social. My mind is just constantly racing and miserable, and I don't know how to fix it. I don't think I could ever commit suicide, but I certainly have started thinking about it a decent amount and that scares me, because I don't want to think about it, and I'm afraid I might actually consider it if my life continues in its current direction.

"I've never felt worseI'm sitting in college alone right now and my eyes feel so heavy and want to burst out crying but i don't think i can anymore.

I've had a bad childhood but back when i was younger i had a few friends that i stook with for years of school, when college came around i talked less and less and my life got worse and worse.

Someone came into my life and made it the best I've ever felt for 2 years. Those 2 years sadly came to an end a few days ago. I always thought people who were heart broken were overreacting about how much it hurt but fuck i understand it all now. People around me are all so happy and im just tired of it all. I'm trying to hold all this shit in and put on a fake face, but its the hardest shit ever. 

I was depressed before my relationship and it felt so magical like it all went away when i was in it.  Now im not in it I feel worse about myself. I want to eat so much but at the same time i dont want to eat at all, ive never tried suicide because ive never wanted to hurt my mother. fuck im so close to crying now. 

I'm contemplating on not sending this mess because i dont want people to think im doing it for attention, i just want someone to talk to who understands the feelings, i understand i probably wont get any responses because im one of many people who are going through these suicidal thoughts and i cant imagine how people who have been through worse than me are feeling. 

I guess im just at my lowest point in life now but people who keep saying it will get better said that last time and its just getting worse.

My ex has blocked me everywhere and i cant get my mind off of her. i feel like shes the only person who can save me.

This goodbye probably doesn't mean anything to you, plus I didn't bother to read through the rules of this sub so this may or may not be taken down. It's been hard and it's just just getting harder and it's weakened me too much.

Ever since I was just a small innocent child things were bad. Almost every day I was stuck in the middle of my parents fighting each other for years, I'd hide under a table while my parents shouted at eachothe about their marriage and how having children was a mistake. Maybe having me was a mistake. I remember one morning I was sitting down at the dining room table eating breakfast and hear my mother become hysterical upstairs and then run out of the house into the backyard screaming to the sky, I don't remember the words she screamed but later I learned my oldest brother had attempted suicide. I don't remember a lot of things about my childhood, after years of trying to forget so many memories, they've been coming back to me. As a kid I was socially isolated and it stuck with me to this day. I have no friends, I haven't had one my entire life, I panic on the inside even saying one word to people I don't know. I've been thinking about how maybe if I was different and tried to talk to people when I was little,maybe I wouldn't be a social outcast today. Their are so many opportunities I've missed and thrown away and it hurts. I'm a waste of life, my whole life I've been trapped in my own body and I constantly wish that I was someone else. All I can hope for now is that when I die I can come back as a good person that people actually like and care about. If you knew my age you'd definitely say I'm too young, way too young, but why should I stay and wait when things around me have just be crumbling down including myself. I've been crumbling down and know it's like I'm just dust and now it's time for the wind to take me.

"I hate how my dad treats my mom. What I hate even more is how she takes it and tells me to be complacent.My dad, is quite frankly, a giant piece of shit.

My mom was forced to marry him. He wasn’t in the picture until a few months after I was born, and has since then forced my mom to pick up her life and move with little warning. He’s been completely fucking terrible. In preschool I was physically abused and he makes jokes out of it like I haven’t been suicidal since I was fucking 3. He makes extremely disgusting sexual comments about my body, calls me a whore regularly, and thinks I’m overall the biggest slut to have ever walked the earth (for reference, I basicallt wear an abaya everyday.) 

He constantly orders my mom around, and degraded her often making her cry at least once a day, then he tells her to shut up and stop being so sensitive. My mother has openly admitted that if she could only save her husband or her children, she’d pick him. 


I want to love my mom I really do but she is a slave to him. She has no original thoughts of her own. He says jump she says which cliff? I asked him to lower his voice earlier today (he SCREAMS when he talks) because I was working on 3 papers, and she ran up the stairs to call me a worthless whore. 

I will never be enough for my parents and I have no one in this world that loves me. I wish he would just kill me so that she’d understand what kind of person he is. My aunt was killed by her husband and I think she’ll end the same way. I just want to fuckin die. ",2.0

"I know i'm selfish for ending my life, but i'm not sure how i can justify continuing to suffer.Exactly like the title says.

I've heard lots of people tell me that i shouldn't exit because i'll deeply hurt those close to me. I can get on board with that argument, i don't want to hurt anyone. And just because the act of ending my life is intended to end my suffering and not hurt others that doesn't absolve me of the collateral damage, just like shooting a missile to kill known terrorists might be itself justifiable but the collateral damage of killing the children beside those particular terrorists isn't. I can get on board with that argument too.

The follow up is the hard part.

Am i supposed to wait until they (those close to me) die so i can end my life? The logic is that once they are gone i'll have no one close to me. Unfortunately I'm certain i cannot take another few decades of my life, the last two with this depression was quite enough.

Am I supposed to go homeless but keep up appearances in their lives? i'm too shattered to keep working now. My finances are slowly draining away and while i have a bit of cash on the clock it won't be long before i'm a penniless waste of space. These people will not support me when i finally get evicted. Are they to see me for the rest of their lives as a homeless vagrant?

Yes they'll suffer when i die, i acknowledge that. Am i supposed to suffer life for them?

I'm not even actually a part of their lives anymore, i don't see them for months at a time.

What is it about my presence that they honestly would *suffer* from not having? I asked them, i got answers ranging from they needed me to fix their computers to they liked my sense of humor. Other people can fill those roles, is there something about my ridiculously hansom face they can't live without? I'll leave pictures.

I honestly thought life was about maximizing happiness and minimizing suffering. But there doesn't seem to be workable solution here. To maximize the happiness of others i have to minimize my happiness and maximize my suffering. Now to minimize my suffering i'll maximize the suffering of others.

It's not fair.

I have to suffer monstrously to keep up appearances for people i only see a few times a year.

But that's what i'm supposed to do.

I'm required to suffer for others.

I can no longer justify that. I'm selfish. ",2.0

"I want to die to hurt my familyLately I’ve been feeling suicidal two or three days a week, but every time I start gearing up for it I back out last minute (I want to tie a pair of stocking around my neck, I hope it will work). Tonight I sat in the bathroom while my husband slept and punched myself in the head and stomach until I cried.

I keep thinking about my little cousins and nieces and nephews.... and I know some of them are suicidal, I’m someone they look up to.

My husband is a cop, so he has been seeing these things for awhile.... but lately he’s become secretive and kind of..... not there. He is the only one who knows about my depression, I put a really really good face on for everyone else.

We’ve been married for a long time, and all of the sudden it’s like he doesn’t even care when I become depressed. It makes me feel selfish like my depression is just for attention, and it makes me feel guilty and even more depressed.

I was verbally and sexually abused by my parents growing up and it really left a lot of scars on me. Even though I thought I had heated from them they’re all coming back.
What they did makes me hate myself, they always told me I was a burden. Told me no one would love me because I was disgusting. 
I feel disgusting.

I don’t know if I could ever really kill myself, but I feel like I want to start pushing everyone away now before they find out how selfish I am and leave me. 

Or I want to act so selfish that they leave me on my terms....

I don’t know. I ready need support but I can’t reach out to anyone around me because I’m their support and it would crush them.",2.0

"I can't stop thinking about itI have suffered from depression my whole life.  Tried to kill myself multiple times growing up but always failed.  I am on an anti depressant now which seems to keep me mostly level, but when things go wrong it sends me off the deep end.

This afternoon my husband and I had a horrible fight.  He's normally a very sweet and funny guy but he has a nasty temper and blows up a few times a year, this was one of those times.  So he was screaming at me, saying hurtful things while I just begged and begged him to keep his voice down because we live with my parents currently.  He wouldn't and ended up throwing me out of his home office.  I had nowhere to go in the house to be alone so now I'm at a community park with our dog.

I have no one to talk to. No one.  My husband is my best friend usually, but obviously I can't talk to him.  My siblings and I aren't close.  My mother is going through major health issues and is pretty self centered anyway, so I can't really talk to her either.  

I just hate myself so much.  I am a loser.  I am fat, no job.  I have done horrible things in the past.  I wish I could just cease to exist. I wish I just wasn't here anymore.",2.0

"They just throw me away. Every. Single. Night.Recently in an effort to combat my mental instability and reoccurring suicidal ideation, I reach out to my local suicide hotline. I’m not talking the text line or call service but the online chat. 
For 5 nights in a row I’ve reached out and I’ve been stuck waiting for four hours. Every night I call it quits and continue my impulsive drug habits because either their system is timing out and not telling me, or there is so many people and not enough workers.
Last night I was able to get through to the NSPL chat page but no person joined the chat. I did it twice and no one joined. Tonight when I got on there was 50 people. I made it to 26 and it stayed at 26 for a good 45minutes. Then I exited my window and retried. Currently I am up in the line with 7 people ahead of me. It’s been like that for about 30 minutes. 

Besides me trying to get help and support the only way I can confidentially anymore I am finally over it. I am finally over life.
Struggling with everything from staying out of the mental hospital to just plain keeping my emotions in check. Everything is current and goes deeper. The only thing left is to say goodbye.

In the past year, I've had 2 people come forward, One of them being my abuser themselves, in a very public manner, about concerns about how I've been acting, and that they think something is wrong. I dismiss them, while I know it doesn't dissuade them, it at least throws them off my trail like fake throwing a ball for a dog.

The party kids mostly bullied me. The guys would ask me to hook up but not tell anyone. My self-esteem was ruined for a while. I'm from the suburbs of a big city. My school had about 1,600 kids. Most people from my high school went to college. I moved states and haven't been back since graduation.

All those people who bullied me still hang out and are still friends. They all date each other, and when they come home for the holidays, they all hang out. They always post comments on each other's pics. After college, they all moved back to my area or the city. They are all roommates and got apartments together.


I feel so alone and weird. I ghosted and stopped seeing my friends after graduation. I got off social media. I live in southern California now I go to school and have an excellent job I've met some great people and traveled. I still feel like a loser because I don't have connections from high school years later.

Am I a weirdo for still not hanging out with people from high school? Is something wrong with me?

tl;dr: I was an outcast in high school and moved away, but most people from my high school still hang out",2.0

"I cant go on like this anymorei really just cant deal with it anymore. My dad constantly puts me down and makes me feel useless.

Im just a lazy piece of shit who will never get anything done. i just want it all to be over. I cant kill myself though because my mom and my brother.

"I think i lost the war with myself todayI (26M) has been contemplating suicide for years now, ive not exactly had the worst life nor the best. I have a somewhat loving family, a good job, good friends, everything that should make a person happy, but im not.

I wouldn't say i am particularly sad, i am just nothing, i almost have no feeling at all. I literally feel like an empty vessel that does what it has to do, anyway going a little off topic there as ive finally decided i am to end my own life, i have ran out of reasons to carry on living, i have written notes to the people closest to me and im actually ready. I haven't been this sure of anything in a long time, it's an odd feeling tbh, i feel comfort from knowing this is going to be the end very soon, i know its contradictory but i almost feel happy. Its such a strange feeling.

I did have therapy, anti depressants, you name it ive tried it, nothing worked as i just think its as simple as i don't want to be here anymore.

Im sorry for posting something like this but i wanted to share my thoughts with someone that isn't to close too me, feels like closure really.

"I don't understand why suicide is so frowned upon.I'm a 23 year old female and I've been suicidal for all of my adult life and the majority of my adolescence. It's not that my life is terrible or that I've lost someone that I care about, I just truly don't want to be here. I do not want to be a part of society and I feel it's unfair that I've been thrown into this life and am expected to live it just because I was born. I do not find joy in things or people and I haven't for most of my life. I do not make real connections with people. I don't really care about anything. I fear that everyday of the rest of my life is going to be like this: empty and quite frankly, pointless. Why continue on? For the few people I haven't shoved out of my life? Why am I the selfish one for wanting to leave this god forsaken planet? Aren't they selfish for wanting to keep me here even though I'm miserable? 
I don't really want any, ""oh everything will get better one day, you'll see. Just keep trucking"" because its not really like that for me. I don't think it's a mindset or a mood. It's my personality. I hate life.. I hate society and their bullshit rules and pretty much every person I've ever encountered. Why stay?

"Returning to work after failed suicide attempt and extended leave.About 3 weeks ago I attempted suicide, failed, was in the psych unit 2.5 days and returned home to the care of my therapist and psychiatrist. Work doesn't know why I was in the hospital, just that I was and am on fmla. They will know why today bc i had to submit paperwork to HR to cover my leave. I was supposed to go back today but my anxiety has been horrible since I have been out of the hospital and it was even worse this weekend w the anticipation of going back to work. 

The backstory to this is I already have a history of anxiety and depression which work is aware of bc I've taken leave before, this time it got to the point where I would have rather killed myself than return to work. I work w an adult w autism who's aggressive and it's triggered a lot of anxiety/ptsd crap and whatever. I got injured by him more than once and I was blamed for it and I'm also in the middle of some workers comp case for the injury, had to get a lawyer etc. so that's still in limbo and I'm not sure if work is aware I got a lawyer yet either.

Perhaps the worst of it is seeing your sibling being better at life than you in every way. He is going to better school, getting better gpa, has ridiculous amount of friends, has had success with girls, casually goes to vacation with his friends during holidays.

I've tried to ""go outside"" as suggested. But I've never been a risk taker, and my self-esteem has been rock bottom since high school. I couldn't make any friends let alone a girlfriend and surrounding myself with people who are better socially than I am didn't help either.

I have no future, and no one to share it with even if I did have one. I'm thinking about ending it all when I graduate college, which won't be too far from now.

"Is my roommate suicidal? The other night after studying all day in his room, my roommate, a hilarious and charming guy, ""jokingly"" got up on a chair and tied a belt around his neck and the ceiling. I immediately got up and he told me to relax. We then exchanged sarcastic/silly reasons not to end his life (he has to do laundry tomorrow, he's too good looking to kill himself, I don't want to wake up to his dead body, etc) 

He put up this antics for about 20 minutes then proceeded to cry before going to sleep. After he got down, he said he just wanted to feel from another perspective, and reassured me he wasn't going to kill himself. I wasn't really worried that he was actually going to kill himself that moment, but I am worried about his mental state. Right now, he's back to his studying. 

What should I do? I know he lost his parents few months ago and he's being more jaded with his major/grades. ",2.0

"what if I failI am a foreigner, have not graduated from the med school in my damn home country yet. I am preparing for USMLE because I want to be a doctor here, and I want to immigrate to  USA, too. Since my home country is totally hellish.

But I am really not that excellent, not smart, and it is so difficult to prepare when you did not attend American med school. I am in the ""best "" med school in my home country, but still, just trash. Otherwise it won't be so hard to prepare.

Sometimes I feel like, I do not have any hope. I cannot make it happen, I can never make it. As an forefinger med student  I have to get 250+ ( super high score)  in step 1 to have a chance to match. But my brain is like, atrophy.

I am 24 now, when I graduate I will be 27. If I cannot success in this then what did I burnt all my youth for ?

It is so painful to continue, and more painful to give up. Recently I cannot stop thinking isn't it easier to suicide, no more anxiety. But damn it is a sin to suicide, too! Can life be more cruel? I am sure it will.

Not sure what I want to say, I may have depression, I don't care. Hope I will somehow die tomorrow.

"My girlfriend broke up with me then tried to kill herselfMy girlfriend has had many problems in the past concerning her mental health and has attempted suicide many times before. However recently it has gotten worse we had an argument the day before where she claimed that all she wanted to do was hurt people and she didn't want to hurt me so she blocked almost all forms of communication I have with her however I convinced her how much she meant to me and i think she stopped and I diffused the argument. The next day she said some bullshit excuse and broke up with me and pleaded that I shouldn't do anything stupid as I have had mental health issues in the past aswell. I was pissed of but I didn't realise it so I acted very passive aggressive which I regret so much. Later on that day she tried to kill herself with a knife. However now she is in hospital receving treatment for depression which is always good.

I have incurred 90,000 dollars in education debt.
I have not learned anything in college and graduate school in spite of being in school for 10 years, probably because I made the mistake of studying subjects I am not interested in.

We became internet friends maybe 5 years ago, since then we are really close. She can tell me whatever she wants and if she will feel better after, i'll be all ears.   
She's 7 years older than me (i'm 23).  she has a difficult life. after the divorce of her parents, the mother began to hate her daughter since childhood. Until now, her mom is very toxic. ""Others may have a good life, but you don't, because it's you. You ruin everything as always"" her mom says that.    
of course my friend thinks so because her closest relative is telling that.   
She doesn't have close friends in real life so it's really hard to feel that you're not alone.   
Many bad things happens in everyone's life. She already have few suicide attempts but at that time she was afraid to make it to the end. Right now she's feeling so bad. She's not afraid anymore. She wants to stop feeling that pain. She has  hallucinations about her ex and bad things that he has done to her. When she thinks about suicide she feels good and free. She thinks that it's an escape for her. And everything will be good without her.  


It will happen in 2 week. And i don't know what to do, what to say to her. What can i say? ""Don't worry. Everything will be okay"". Well it's stupid to say that.

"I need ways to prevent myself from committing suicideI am genuinely suicidal. I get this way when I am really stressed out and unable to cope. I am autistic and I do have trouble regulating my emotions. I get impulsive urges to hurt myself when I am upset. Because acting out in any way when I'm upset leads to consequences I would rather not have to deal with, I have learned to internalize all of my anger and stress and frustration. It builds up and can't get out. Then I get suicidal. 

I used to self-harm which acted as an outlet. I have been doing other things to try to help but they aren't working. Some things, like listening to music, or watching tv/movies are actually triggering for me because I have been abused, raped, etc. A lot of media contains violence or themes that make these emotions worse.

I usually get stuck in a loop of suicidal thoughts/impulses/urges to hurt myself. They last for days or weeks. Sometimes they go away for months or longer. They have been getting worse recently and more serious. Last time I was hospitalized. Which, by the way, did nothing to help me. It was a nightmare. I cannot call any hotlines. They have never once helped. They are entirely useless. Also they contact the police if they think you are a threat to yourself. No thanks. I have lost all faith in any kind of mental health professionals as well. 

I do think I am at risk for harming myself. This is not a cry for help or a way to vent. I want actual advice on how to help myself before I end up dead.  I have been very close to impulsively ending my life several times in the last few days.",2.0

Not even the person I considered my best friend has even messaged me to say hello. I feel tossed aside and alone. I have had constant anxiety since Sunday with no break. Yesterday I thought about hurting myself and killing myself. I am always thinking about killing myself lately. I feel alone and worthless. I don't have anyone to talk to. I don't want to wake up lately. Everyday I wake up I am panicking and sometimes crying because I have no happiness in my life. I don't want to do anything. The usual things I find happiness in don't bring me that anymore. I want to die. I have always considered myself broken and this only confirms it. My ""best friend"" was the first one I had ever had in life. Guess I was lead astray into thinking that. All I do now is apply for jobs, think about hurting myself, think about killing myself, cry, and have a constant and never ending anxiety attack. All I want to do right now is hurt myself. I hate everything right now. Nothing brings me happiness. I have no one. I am no one.",2.0

"Rough story from this weekend.Last night, I had a bit too much to drink and ended up kinda spoiling my friends' night. It came out of me that I wanted to kill myself. One of my friends sat with me and talked to me. I opened up about feeling like nobody in my life really cares about me and like I'm the odd one out in every place I go. He said he cared about me, and wanted to get me to bed but he'd check up on me in the morning. I told him that I've gone through similar things before and know how'd it go, people just displace me and I become a burden to them. He told me that's not how it'd be. Today I woke up to a lot of shit and negativity from friends. I tried talking to him again and he ignored my messages the entire day. It turns out, he just again validated my fear and trauma of being cast aside by people I open up to. I am indescribably hurt by this feeling getting cemented. This has really made me feel compelled to kill myself tomorrow because I again feel like I have no one. Please someone help me feel better about this.",2.0

The feeling is compounded by my friends calling me the ""smart kid"" which makes me fear the day they realize I'm not as smart as I thought.

"I've tried everything.I've been having these feelings for a while now. I almost admitted myself into a psych ward two months ago because of it. The only reason I didn't was because if I decided life was worth living after doing that, I would be embarressed. I would be a burden to everyone that knew. Always having to tread lightly for fear of sending me into another episode. I don't want that. I don't want to cause anybody else any harm and know about it. I'm treated like dirt. Absolute garbage. I do nothing but good for everyone I encounter. Even strangers. But nothing good ever comes my way. I don't do those good things and expect anything in return. I just hope that one day a ray of fucking sunshine will brighten up my very depressed life. My Father practically wants nothing to do with me. I haven't heard from my Mother in god knows how long. The last thing she said to me was that she didn't want to be in my life anymore. Like she was even a part of it to begin with. She had the nerve to tell me not to contact her again. Like for some reason knowing I was alive caused her a great deal of stress. I spend every holiday usually spent together with family sitting alone crying because I'm not wanted by the people I care about most. I've tried everything. Therapy. Medication. Hell, I even tried believing in God. But then the argument came to my head ""If he really existed, why would he cause so much pain and hurt for someone that gives his all for everyone?"". Nothing is going to help me. I'm sick of feeling like this. I just don't want to be here anymore. I've put up with too much shit. The people here obviously don't care about me.

My friends know that I have terribly low self esteem but they don’t seem to care. One of them jokes about me being worthless. I understand that he’s joking around with me but I always believe him whenever he says that.

"I fucked upThis year I managed to wreck every single relationship (family, friends, acquaintances...) through either being too passive or pretending to be someone I am not. The one person I still think would talk with me I am too weak to reach out to. I had one major fuckup in February that I can never forgive myself for. How I handled the situation also cost me all my self respect. Last month I lost intrest in most things I used to enjoy, although right now I can still force myself to do some of those things, I either feel bad or nothing at all whilst doing them.

 I tried to kill myself last week but backed off a few hours in (I think because I didn't want hurt that one person). Sometimes I feel like reaching out, but I stop before actually trying. I am too embarrassed about this since I know that my life should be quite comfortable objectively speaking. I can't hold on to that anymore. I just want to return to how things used to be. Knowing that this isn't possible, I made plans to try and kill myself at new years. Doing that pacified me and is probably the reason why I feel like writing this. I came to see suicide as a way to repay all those people I have wronged and that makes me feel somewhat happy as well.

It's almost 2 weeks since i got a major fight with my brother because he didn't want to accompany me to look for a job by saying that he's busy, but the fact is he's always have time to hang out with his damn girl, and my parents was fucking blaming me for that, and then I starved myself that day, i lost my appetite, I can't (and i don't want) utter a single fuck to them since that day. I have the other brother actually, but now he has his own family already, he also don't give a fuck about me, he only focuses on his family.

I really don't know where to apply job, i only have low education because we're not a rich family. Been constantly rejected by companies. Jobless for 2 years.

And now the thought of stabbing myself right in the chest is haunting me everyday.",2.0

I was falsely accused of rape by a girl just because I didn't want to date her and she had a chronic victim complex. I felt like my life was over, persecuted in an unfair system (old Title IX) and even if I was found innocent it was going to cause irreparable damage. 

During that time it was a violent complusive desire to die. I had a sharp stabbing pain that I wanted out of. 

It's shifted. It's been nearly two months of hell and the pain has become dull and constant. I'm getting real tired. Everything seems dark now. I used to be so happy, I thought everyone was at heart good and they were just misguided. I'm so tired now. I just wanna stop walking.

I don't want to give the name of the store but they sell big clothing brands. I am incredibly lucky to be working there as my first job. I have lots of benefits and everyone is very nice, also the work is pretty easy. 

Despite all this, I want to die now more than I've wanted to in a long time. I can't do this. This isn't me. I'm not supposed to be here I'm supposed to be dead or in a hospital. This feels so wrong. I hate the hospitals but there is comfort in familiarity at times, also it removes responsibility from me, not that I have much to be responsible for. This feels so wrong I really dont belong here I should kill myself now.

I can only see I'm body rotting with my head inside a plastic bag that is fixed to my shoulders with duct tape. That's all I see and that's what I want I want it so bad.

"It is strange when you think about itWhy do we think life and living in general is that great, heck it is expensive, I'm not condoning suicide or living in general but if you think about it, we are just some biological piece of sh** floating around aimlessly wandering around in space just to die in the end.. I think those of them who tried to stopped me from suicide are s***"" who don't understand the fundamental concept of reality,, I think life in general is a load of bs and bat s crazy stuff .. Mine was depression, financial difficulties and philosophical problems, the problems I had to face in the past due to poverty selling drugs, got beaten almost to death just because I sold drugs for food,  for food btw for food to feed my family because I lose a ton of money in some shitty financial crisis (and no I don't even drink alcohol and I don't do drugs), living a s***** live, mom's cancer during our darkest family poverty days, dad's alcoholism (death again) due to depression because of the financial neck deep sh** we've gotten into and finally the death of both my parents and to add some salt to the wound, the death of my only best friend led me to conclude that, for some of us, Live is not worth living the problems outweigh the things I will obtained in the near future, and even if I have financial security I will never bring back my loved ones, I think reality just don't rhyme well with, ahh it will be better, eat your anti depressants, and s*** like god and optimism is so f****** annoying , be strong and all these forced lies are somewhat, to me, Ignorant, Arrogant and insulting to my intelligence and the sh** ton of experience I was forced into... Now I think there is a fair point , a reasonable point for me to commit suicide, life is not great to that guy who is about to say it will get better because no, I'm about to be homeless with no job, debts and the same s*** I've been into , why should I desire to live?? For the better days I will be sleeping in dirt and rain? People who have been through shit harsher and worser condition may give me advice and practical solution the rest can shut the f up because I've been through hell more than you.. And I don't need your money or help i need a sound practical advice from people who had been through this so called 'Wonderful Hobbesian world' worse than mine, and no, doctors, if you are a practising psychiatrist you can f*** off because you don't mean s*** in my situation drug and therapy don't help in these s***** situations..

I’ve dealt with anxiety for 7+ years, depending on what you mark as the origin of it, and in the past several years I’ve tried every non-medical solution google came up with/my wallet allowed.

Honestly, there was a lot of support and encouragement to seek treatment from people I talked to about it previously.

When I left the house for the post office one hour ago, I found two letters for SO and I. Both were our respective tax invoices for this year, so it's a shitload of money that's due by the end of the year. One third of the amount's even due by the end of this month.

As if having lost my job with pretty much all of my savings dried up wasn't bad enough, this is throwing me off completely. Ever since I've started (unsuccessfully) looking for a new job things are getting gradually worse, so committing suicide is dominating my thoughts more and more. And still... I can't do it.

Going into one of those places isn't going anything but make things worse. I've been in them like 4 times. All they do is put you in there for like a week and then I just end having a bill to pay when I barely have any money to begin with. Plus my mom who is terminally ill is getting worse. She's the most important person in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. I'm so anxious to the point where I swear I get borderline paranoid. And it feels like things keep getting worse, and worse, and worse. 

There's a part of me that doesn't want to die and there's another part that just wants this shit to end. And I'm afraid that I might impulsively try to attempt suicide. Because I've done it twice already and each time it was impulsive. And I don't want to hurt my mom, she says I'm all she has left and my brother committed suicide so I think that doing that would break her.

"I'm killing myself because of my 5 year old sisterEver since the kid was born, my mental and physical health have been deteriorating. Every single day since she was a newborn, i've woken up to screaming. 5 years straight. You'd think that a 5 year old would not cry/scream for no reason anymore, but that is all she does. Its been suggested that she has autism, but my mom gets defensive and says she does not, therefore she will never get treatment if she actually has it.

I have panic disorder and I usually wake up panicking. Sometimes I can calm myself, but the effort I put into self soothing is ruined as soon as she starts shrieking. My old therapist said I need a calm, peaceful environment in order to recover, because my brain is frayed. 

She doesn't get punished. She is allowed to scream, bully and whine without punishment. The way her and my mom communicate is screaming matches. If my mom and dad didn't want to deal with another kid, they shouldn't have had one. Right now I can hear them in another room screaming at eachother. My sister is whining, calling my mom names and shrieking at the top of her lungs because she can't have a friend over, and my mom is yelling ""SHUT UP!"". Its the same thing every single day.

I can't do it anymore. I can't listen to this, and I can't watch my parents raise a bratty monster. I never wanted another sister, because I *knew* it would be like this.

Ever since she was a newborn, i've been telling myself ""It will get better. Its a phase. She will get older and behave."" But it is not happening. She's still the exact same. And the damage to my brain and body is already done.

My mom has changed. She is not the loving, nurturing woman I used to know. I burst into tears when I think of how she used to be. She is now irritated 24/7 and never has time to help me(with my anxiety or depression). 

I truly wish life could have been different. I can't help but look back and pity the day my mom and dad decided on having another child. If only they knew how stressful it would be. I know my parents don't want to deal with it either, but they won't admit it. I can't do it though. I'm just so depressed and worn out.",2.0

Everyone I try to talk to changes the subject or wants to know what is so terrible about my life that I'd want to end it. Nothing! That's the thing! There is nothing wrong!  I am intelligent, conventionally attractive, have a wonderful relationship, a phenomenal family, a great job, on track to get my masters, and all in all I could have a very successful life. I don't care! That life could go to anyone. What do I care if it's a waste? The only person missing out on it is me. And I don't care! 

It makes no sense. I wish my brain would work normally and appreciate what I have. I posted yesterday and I decided I was pathetic.  I'm going to try and talk to someone. No one cares. No one understands. I have no time or money to find a counselor even if there were anyone taking clients.  I feel like I'm screaming that I want to die!! And no one is answering. There is no one. I have called the suicide hotline. They say you have a lot to live for. Things will get better. They haven't gotten better in almost a decade. ""You don't have the life experience to know you will make it out of this."" Oh my god! I'm 24 years old. That's fine. I'm young. But almost half of my life has been taken over by thoughts of killing myself. Every day. Every day! It's so exhausting!

Go talk to someone? Do you really think anyone wants to hear about the girl with the ""perfect life"" who wants to die? No. They don't.  I'll tell you that right now. I know how my brain works. I know this is my chemical makeup for the rest of my life. Even if I try to fool it with medication.  Medication doesn't work because I know it's a facade. Underneath that medication is a fucked up brain that will never be better on its own. It's pathetic. I'm pathetic. I can't find a counselor so this is my sounding board. I just want help.

Having some real trouble seeking appropriate advice and have intention to further my problems by necking it. Not the first time and hopefully the last.  Been to hospo a few times because of it in the last 12 months. 

Reverted back to self mutilation to cope but that isn’t working. Tried to calm by smoking up, again, little to no effect. Opted to drinking and Valium (not a regular drinker) and even that won’t settle me. 

Background: have had DV (domestic violence) problems at home with a very hostile younger brother, pressure to achieve at work, my mother recently having some surgery and regularly moves between Melbourne and Hobart. extreme expectations of myself, beginning a course at uni and not being able to see my regular psychiatrist for 2 months because he took on too many patients too quickly. I don’t have a friend or trusted source to express my concern to, but cannot see a future anymore. 

Not even a month ago I was good to go, excited about future, and I’m that was the prospect of an esteem building surgery to help my body confidence. I no longer want to attend training or sport (usually an AFL and netball player), have cancelled any future mental health based appointments, and withdrawn from my course. Id prefer to prepare myself for my end date at this point. 

I hate the fact that colleagues and family are commenting on my poor attitude, my mother telling me to ‘cheer up’ and that I’m overloading her stress levels. 

I hate who I am, what I do and see no purpose in moving forward in life anymore; I’m no longer a reliable or helpful person that can achieve anything, and cannot see a purpose of moving forward to achieve anything.

I have all letters written and sitting out for my loved ones. I left a paper at the bottom of the stairs for them to not let my parents find me and to call 911. I have been suicidal for as long as I can remember now. I'm 24 f. I'm medicated and in therapy. Been hospitalized twice. I've been abused mentally, physically, and molested by my own cousin as a child from the ages of 3-11. In a relationship with a female that I can't find the effort to even write the details about. I'm being pushed over the edge. No friends, not even my gf as she just told me she is living a double life and lying to me about everything. Nothing is true and nothing is real. It's so easy for people to see someone suffering from a physical disease pass, and for everyone to say they are at least not in pain/suffering anymore. Why can't I have that.  ",2.0

My trauma occured five years ago, and it doesn't bother me anywhere near as much as it used to (thanks to some tricks I learned on here and through my own research), and I believe I've been handling it all okay.

I have these suicidal idealizations, and never acted on them. But I'm afraid that might change in the future when she is gone. I'm scared that I might breakdown badly. I always try to repress my emotions and not get too close to anyone or anything. I'm so scared because my grandmother is probably the closest person to me.",2.0

I am causing more suffering than I am getting relieved how is that fair. I'm going to slowly withdraw from the world. Clearly there is no help in the medical field. I've had two psychiatrists and 2 therapists. I've had 26 appointments with the current psychiatrist and have been through 30+ different meds I'd say more than 30 meds but don't wanna run the risk of sounding like I'm exaggerating. The feelings I have can't be defined or explained and therefore can't be helped. I haven't been able to put words to how I'm feeling to anyone I just know The people around me don't feel like this and the people around me don't have to take 10 pills a day to feel incredibly hopeless. I take Xanax or lorazepam and drink almost every night now and spend 80-100$ per week on weed/dabs. I know it is rare but I can't be helped I've seen the top doctors in my area and it is excruciatingly guilt-producing since I know how much my parents worry about me and how much they spend. We can afford it just fine but I just feel like the monetary equivalent of a special-needs kid.  I'm 20. I live at home and was commuting to a great college until I had to apply for a medical Leave of Absence. I did this freshman year for the same reasons. I wasn't suicidal that time.

"First night postingI posted this to /r/depression but I've been lurking this sub a lot longer.  I've been depressed for almost 15 years.  About the length of some of the people in this sub I bet.  Not bragging, it's horrible.  Are there any older people like me here? Sometimes I think about people I used to know, people that used to feel like me, and see that they have apparently grown out of it, and I see myself still thinking about suicide everyday.  Why can't I just snap out of it or ""outgrow"" it and wake the fuck up and get my act together?  Sometimes I wonder if seeking help will even yield results at all, or has it been so long that I've gone off the deep and and this feeling of depression has taken a hold of me and corrupted my soul.  I can't even remember feeling happy anymore, how do I differentiate me from these feelings? Sometimes I feel like I AM depression.  It's seeped into my brain and taken a hold of all existence.  I have a good life.  I have a job, a loving girlfriend, a car, friends, family.  But every time I'm in a social setting (like tonight, baby shower) I get so fucking sad.  I sit there in the room and I see smiling faces laughing and having fun.  I can laugh too but inside all I feel is inadequate.  It's hard to even put into words what I feel as I sit there.  I sit there next to my girlfriend and know she should be there with someone else who is better.  Someone who has a passion about life and enjoys everyday activities and can feel life 100%.  She should be sitting next to someone who can sit there and be present and not think about all of this in the back of their head.  Not holding back watery eyes thinking that I shouldn't be there, I shouldn't exist at all, I'm just taking up space.  I'm holding everyone back.  Everyone is a positive force, pushing happiness and personality into the universe and I'm a fucking black hole.  Anti matter.  Just wanting to fade away.

"Always good but never enoughHey there, I'm going to just park this post over here and see what happens.


I have had depression since late 2013 and it has kept fluctuating ever since. In the process, I was bullied for a while, both physically and mentally abused by my family, and sexually harrased. Besides those, I worked towards some achievements and accomplished them, but never a hundred per cent. Always good, but never enough.


Recently, I told my mother that I was sexually harrased. In response, she said something to me with an underlying message of: ""You had it coming/deserved it."" This may be it for me. I had done nothing to deserve that act, yet had to convince her to it. She has shown no sign of sympathy or help. This is my one and only mother. It is such a letdown.


I've always and always tried to act nice to people. I've always been kind, helping and when I could not help, listening. And the responses like these are what makes me question if I can endure what I am going through. I've always been an underachiever, have never done enough, and I cannot put real effort into anything since my depression successfuly convinces me that my efforts will prove worthless nonetheless.

"What is the purpose of life?Hello.

Some people in this group maybe know me because I've talked to lot of people who have (or had) suicide thoughts in this reddit group. I always told this people that it's worth it, to continue living but now I actually think why I said that. Seriously, what's the point in living? Most people live very simple lives and don't really question the purpose of their life. When they're kids/teenagers they go to school, then they work, maybe have a relationship, maybe have kids and then die someday. But what's the point of going through this boring cycle? Why not die now if we anyway now that we will die sooner or later? To continue living our lives as we do at the moment other ones have to suffer for us. If we eat meat animals are killed for us. Why? Just because so many idiots like the taste of meat and just take the future of those animals to eat a steak, etc. To live our lifes like that we have to oppress other species. We simply destroy natural habitats of animals just to build cities or villages in this places. The only thing that we cause on this world is pain. We harm the environment so that we can drive around in our big stupid SUVs and so on. And what for? No one thinks about that question. Why do people in general think that they're heros if they prevent a suicidal person from killing themselves (mostly even against their will)? Why? WHY? In greek mythology a story even says (I don't know which one) that humans only were created to amuse the gods and have no other reason to live. I know that I sound very selfish when I'm saying that, but I don't give a fuck how my family feels after they will find my dead body. What are the reasons why you guys continue living?",2.0

But the feeling has been getting stronger and stronger my whole life.  Suicide seemed kind of outrageous when I was younger and with each year, each month, it seems more and more like the way.  

I am very lonely.  I am disgusted by the people around me but I also have a lot of love for them.  I want to love myself and I have tried.   

To no success.   I feel ugly and desperate.  I burst into tears a lot and everything seems purposeless. My therapist is no help.  

Im so fucking alone.  And I could reach out to people if I want to. I know how to be charming.  I am good looking and go to a good school.  I have lots of good things and so on.  

But I fucking hate people.  And I fucking hate myself.  As much as I know this is a toxic and degenerative mindset, I cannot shed it. 

I don't want to be around people.  There is nothing I want to work for.  Everyone I am close to exasperates and exhausts me.

"How much does my life belong to me?I am nearing 50 and for a long time have been seriously considering saying goodbye. It is clear to me that things will be a downward spiral from here on out. Alcoholism, depression, chronic illness and not to mention being a mediocre, shitty person in general (though i have mananged to keep that mostly secret to this point)

Being a coward by nature the actual process of suicide does frighten me, but more than that is the impact it will have on wife, children, mother.  It would kill my mother (now 80) and seriously fuck up my kids (11 and 17). My wife would of course be hurt but she is a lot stronger than me and, in any case, if she really knew me she would not be nearly so sad.

How do we draw the line? My name is divorce or die but that is misleading. Divorcing isnt going to make me better or happier, it is not a question of ""or "" but ""and"" but maybe if i get a divorce first and wait a year or two before dying it would be better for them? Create distance?

How much do i owe my life to others? I am done with it. Seriously. I understand that things might get better and medication and so on, but no. No. I am done. How long do i have to hold out? If i die tonight they will have a million plus in assets. Considering my income, that is a lot--certainly makes up for lost income.

At what point can i prioritise my own relief over others' potential pain? I stay up late every night so that i can cry after everyone had gone to bed. Its not that i want to cry, but i bottle it up all day long and can only let it out then. I feel like i am going to snap and unravel at any moment....  how much do i owe them?

"Why I want to kill myself.1. Most of my days are ruined by how I feel about myself. I obsess over my looks, my body and compare myself to every girl i pass in the street and see online. I think if I don't look like a model life isn't worth living. If I don't lose 20 pounds, I might as well kill myself. Many days I don't get out of bed simply because I don't want to have to get dressed and look at myself in the mirror. I believe that any good picture of me is a good angle fluke. I don't believe I have body dysmorphia, I believe everybody that tells me im attractive is lying or has a  fucked up perspective on beauty. This extreme obsession with my looks is not only shallow and pathetic but life ruining.

2. All my friends and boyfriend are long distance and it aches. I met them online (I have no friends in real life due to not clicking with anyone and leaving school at 13 because my anxiety and depression was too bad), but have met up with them. I'm seeing my boyfriend in a month but then I have to say goodbye again for 4 months and it aches and breaks my heart everyday. I so desperately wish it wasn't long distance, but it will be for 3 more years!! I wish my friends lived closer so I could hang out with people rather than spending all day in bed alone.

3. I'm bored to tears, I just got done with the little education I did, waiting on job offers (but getting rejected a lot due to my lack of qualifications, I'm far from stupid thankfully but employers just seem to care about a list of gcses or a levels, I literally volunteered for months in a charity shop and have the perfect experience but am getting rejected from paid work in them simply because of my lacking CV. I spend all day doing nothing but dwell and comfort eat (which does not help issue number 1). I want to dedicate my vast free time to getting healthier and going to the gym, but my depression (and extreme tiredness caused by anemia) laughs in the face at this idea.

4. I have no skills, I can't play an instrument or sing or make art or do crafts or anything that is a hobby. I just need a hobby to focus my bad energy into but I'm such an extreme perfectionist that it feels hopeless and will just make me feel worse when I fail.

"My Boyfriend and I are Both SuicidalI’ve been suicidal as long as I can remember. My boyfriend became extremely depressed after the loss of a loved one and grieves constantly. I feel like I trigger his depression and I know I’m no good for him since I lash out at him all the time when he’s done nothing wrong.

I love him and I think he loves me too, but I can’t even help him anymore. I don’t list any reasons for him to live because I can’t see any for myself. We often talk about driving off the bridge together so that one of us won’t have to endure the other’s suicide.

"Is it weird to plan on committing suicide by a certain age/date/goal?My boyfriend and I are in the process of home buying and considering our financials. We got on the topic of me taking my old well-paying job back up while attending school full time. I was working graveyard full time and doing school full time before, and he feared for my health now and down the road so I quit. 

When I brought up taking my old job back, he was adamant about if I did, he’d set up a strict schedule of sleeping and school for me to adhere to in order to attempt to reduce my odds at getting dementia later in life. I responded with the fact that I don’t plan on really living past 70s, if I even felt like getting to that age in the first place. 

I honestly have nothing I feel I truly live for or want to live for. I’m just kind of here and giving my all to things like school and family and friends, but I don’t feel particularly fulfilled. I have happy moments, but I’ve just always wanted to die. I wanted to cause I hated my life growing up with emotionally abusive parents, depression, suicidal ideations/previous attempts, and loneliness, but just generally now I’m carrying on until I feel I’ve had my fill and then I’m done. 

He wanted to bet on it. Saying he guarantees I’ll change my mind. I told him sure, it doesn’t matter to me, cause the older I get, the sooner I want to die but I haven’t decided exactly when (just a general goal frame) but I definitely don’t plan on getting old and decrepit. He was visibly and audibly upset, but didn’t express any of it more in words to me other than the bet. 

Honestly, I’m not gonna lie and say “yeah sure I’ll grow old with you and we can die together when we’re super elderly” when I just really am pretty set on living life the way I want to as best as I can and ending it on my own terms as well.",2.0
I want to be suicidal?I'm not really sure what I'm feeling but I don't want to exist but I don't want to kill myself because I'm too much of a pussy. I know people love me and I don't want to hurt anyone particularily my boyfriend because I know if I killed myself that would kill him and I just can't put him through that. I'm just so overwhelmed by life and I don't know if I want to go through with the life I've set up for myself and all my goals seem so unappealing to me. The only time I'm happy is when I'm with my boyfriend but I'm eighteen and still live with my parents and I'm not allowed to be alone with him and can only visit him for a few hours at a time. I just wish I wasn't too scared to kill myself and that I had nothing preventing me from doing it. Everything is too much and more often than not lately I've just wanted to die.,2.0
"Question about helping someoneHello, I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this. My fiancé is pretty suicidal in general. I do not believe there is immediate risk as he is pretty stable, but he is struggling. Apologies if questions like this aren't permitted.

He used to self harm a lot, but stopped because he was getting better and he knew it upset me. He's going through a particularly rough time right now and he's relapsed a few times in terms of self harm. Because he's not meant to do it because we've acknowledged it as a negative coping measure and he knows I don't like him doing it (I've had friends severely hurt themselves by self harming, infections etc.), It makes him feel really guilty, which makes any relief short lived and he ends up feeling worse.

However, he says that cutting makes him feel more in control and more able to deal with things and less likely to think of suicide. I am wondering to what extent I should ""allow"" him to cut. If I allowed it, he would not feel guilt about it as much and it may help him to feel together enough that he might be able to do things (he stayed in bed all day today due to depression). I could even potentially make sure that he has a safe, clean and not too sharp implement to do it with and check over any wounds regularly instead of him trying to hide them(I'm first aid trained). I'd urge him to not do it too often, but if it did happen, I'd not treat it as a bad thing. With addictions of multiple sorts, humans tend to go overboard once they fall off the wagon: ""Well, I've ruined it now, might as well do a few more"". Maybe it being allowed would minimise.

Or maybe allowing it could lead to increased dependence on something that ultimately needs to not happen and could make him cut more often and lose track of how much he's doing.

What should I do? My priority is keeping him safe and that's harder to do if he is edging closer to acutely suicidal every day. I also can't help him to get help when he is overwhelmed by it all so much.",2.0

I don’t want to get in details but it was not too explicit but enough to ruin my life mentally and haunt me. I never thought me, how could I, I’m the nicest, genuine guy I know. I care for people, loving family and I am a part of that, why did I do that. Why did god allow this to happen. I’m a fucking freak for it and I get shivers.
Besides those thoughts buried deep in my head, I’ve always fought depression, and since I’ve moved out on my own, it’s become serious. 
Today I found out my sister has been getting abused through text trying to get her to do things by some fucking creeps, they mentally abuse her and have led her to believe she’s nothing. They’ve pushed her to become sucidal. My whole life I’ve tried to make sure I guide her to live the life she deserves, she’s just a fucking wholehearted kid. I’ve always tried to be a good role model and then this shit.

the only thing keeping me going is making very, very gory and emotionally uncomfortable art, some of my stuff has been intense enough to cause a loved one to cry to me over it, so now those ""close"" to me dont really see any aspect of my true feelings any more, it's all too intense for people who love you. i dont want to be a burden any more.

"HelloI'm a bit nervous to post here, because normally I hate drawing attention to myself. But maybe it will help if I type this for other people to see. 

I have a group of friends that I care about and a family that loves me very much, as I love them. Yet I still get these feelings that hurt me inside. Things will be going great and I won't have a care in the world. Then the smallest thing will set me off, and give me all of these bad thoughts. 

I'm sure they stem from my own insecurities, but my brain makes up these scenarios that nobody really likes me, that they're pretending. That they probably find me annoying or obnoxious because of how I cling to the few people that I think care about me in my life. That they would probably prefer it if it was just them hanging out without me. 

When these thoughts come to my mind, it gives my anxiety. I get worried over nothing, I start overthinking everything, and my chest starts hurting. After that subsides, I just get really sad and I get suicidal thoughts. Like maybe they would all be better off not having someone with this much emotional baggage in their life. 

I know that I have people in my life who would be terribly sad if I died, which I'm sure is one of the biggest reasons that I haven't done anything too crazy. But the thoughts in my head keep coming back, and it's driving me a bit crazy. 

I apologize if this is not the sub I should be posting this in. Thank you for reading.",2.0

"Being pushed but judgement when I’m dead stops me.I’m 26/F
I just want to die, it’s this imploding feeling that I sit back and watch myself do.
I live with my mum and dad and younger sister,
The only reason I’m still here is because of my sister.
My mother is very much like me and I constantly see her own mental health issues.
It makes me realise that that is where I’m going and makes it seem even more pointless.
Life is just to much recently with the stresses of work and uni, I want to take a break from uni but my families judgement is to much.
3 months ago I broke my shoulder and it stopped me doing a lot of the things I use to like the gym and be able to work.
This injury has broken me mentally and the only way I found to cope was to turn my pain into distraction by pursuing a guy I liked and talking to him everyday over the past 4 months.
As of yesterday I finally decided to set things straight and have it confirmed that he doesn’t want to lead me on... fair he did it in a nice way but I feel like that’s it then because he did distant himself and I should just leave him alone.
Between all this happening I just feel like a pest to him, my friends, my colleagues and my parents.
No one really knows the suffering I have been feeling lately and I know if I kill myself everyone will be like blah blah blah she killed herself over this guy.
That’s not true at all.
I want to kill myself because I’m over this repeative means of life, the last few years are constantly the same and I’m watching people come and go out of my life and I feel stuck.
I’m just over existing.

"I don't even know what to do anymoreMy life has went downhill since February 2018. Yeah, 9 months from now. Back in the day, I used to be a happy go lucky guy, who spent his time joking about everything and making a lot of friends in order to have fun. But even with that point of view, I realized I never truly experienced happiness.

And, when I realized that, along with all the bad things that were happening to me, I realized I didn't have any reasons left to live. And that was 9 months ago. Nowadays, it still is the case, unfortunately.

I have huge problems related to love. I get attached too quickly on what should just be dumb crushes. I was in love with my best friend for 14 months, and she never returned my feelings. Then, I fell in love with that girl who ended up dating one of my best friends 3 weeks ago. And now? I feel like I still have feelings for my best friend. And that's killing me inside.

During those 9 months of depression, I've attempted suicide 4 times. Once in April, one day before my birthday, once in June, once in July and one last time 5 days ago. I feel like my body is crumbling.

I also scar my body as a way to cope with my sadness, to prevent myself from killing myself, maybe? Yeah, that seems accurate.

But I feel like I won't be able to hold on. I feel like I will not survive 2018. I feel like I will never know 2019.

And I feel like I might kill myself tonight.",2.0

I have cutted myself many times, I know how to cut or how deep. There is no point at suffering everyday and waking up to same shit, unlike many people I am not priviliged. I live in a disgusting country full of religious people and I am 1 hour away from Syria border. Yeah I have few electronic devices and net (which literally everyone has these days except some people).I was born with depression and gender dysphoria, everyday is a sufferieng. I cry everyday at bed, in restrooms or in school. No one helps, whenever I try to reach out they call me attention whore or abuse me. I can't take this everyday, I can't go through all of this everyday. I am sick of drowning in the air around me, I am sick of living as a way I was not meant to be, I am sick of doing it all over again. My parents did not even care when I started cutting myself. I don't want to live a life which has a very bad life standarts, I don't want to live a life where I suffer everyday.

I can barely get up from the bed, I don't have any motivation left to live, I should not have been born, even my parents told me if they knew I would be like this they would abort me. I don't know if I will be able to kill myself tonight, I hope I will manage. People will try to talk to me or send me suicide hotline links.

"I’ve been doing a lot of reckless things in hopes I might die because I’m too chicken shit to just do it myself.I honestly don’t even know where to start with this but I can say that I’m not actively trying to commit suicide. When I was younger I’d have many occurring thoughts of “I could just not turn and drive my car off of this highway into a tree” and things of those sorts, but I was usually pretty controlled. 
My mom died a little over a month ago now and since before I can remember I had plans to kill myself when she died. She was my adopted mom and fairly old and even got Parkinson’s Disease so I knew she wouldn’t last much longer. When she did I had already returned back to my family and reconnected with them, so I knew I couldn’t do anything. And now I’m just stuck in this place of constantly wanting something to just take me out. 
I drive excessively dangerous speeds to and from work (I’m talking over 125mph), picked a couple of fights with people I knew could rip me apart, taken just one more pill than recommended so that I’m knocked out for 12 hours, and my biggest (and most recent) one: 
I got fucking surgery and didn’t follow any of the 10 day diet pre-op guidelines in hopes I would not wake up. 
But here I still am. 
I’m supposed to turn over a new leaf with this surgery and lose a ton of weight (I’ve been a fat bitch since before I was adopted), and in my good moments that sounds absolutely amazing. There’s a lot of active things I’ve thought I’ve wanted to do. 
But there’s also the huge part of me that just wants to eat something huge so it’ll rip up my new stomach and kill me. 
Anyway if this doesn’t get deleted and you read this far thanks I guess. I know I have to go back to therapy and there’s not really much anyone can say to this. But it felt really good to finally get this off of my chest. I’ve been feeling really guilty about how excited my family members are about my surgery with them not even realizing that I would be even more excited for one of them to put a bullet to my head.",2.0

I don't have what it takes to function like a successful person. This world isn't for me. I'm not supposed to be here.

"What would you say to someone who was suicidal, yet did not suffer from depression or any intense tragedies?I used to be depressed and looked around on here a few years back. I was never suicidal, and I'm still not, but still it seems like suicide would be a more reasonable solution to constitutional unhappiness rather than depression. 

I'm not referring to myself specifically, but to illustrate my point I'll provide some context. I don't suffer from a traumatic childhood, it could be described as one, but I've only found strength in it. I don't have trouble dating, whether it's serious or casual, yet it doesn't provide me with happiness or fulfillment. I don't have trouble making acquaintances, forming friendships or close ones either. I have few family members, but they're important ones which I wouldn't swap for anything else. I'm doing well in university, foresee no troubles there or in pursuing an ambitious career I find both interesting and challenging.

Regardless of that, when depressed there's a more or less tangible issue, at least there's a real issue. I enjoy the small things in life, I'm rarely anxious or stressed, or sad. I fill my days doing things I enjoy and I don't have any suicidal thoughts. Still, I could see this leading to it in the long term. The point of life and existence is to get out of it that which you find important, but what if after all, you don't find anything important enough?

You can have success attracting partners, but that doesn't mean you'll find your soulmate or someone you enjoy spending and building a life with. You can find as many friends as you want, but there's a small chance they'll share your outlook on life. When you have no chemical issues, no fog distorting your view of life and no trouble dealing with issues when they arise, how do you deal with an unhappiness in life, after you've analyzed and treated all roots of it?

Again, maybe this is a moot point as there's no reason to think people in that situation will become suicidal rather than mildly apathetic/discontent, but the hypothetical intrigues me.",2.0

I think about being dead more than I think about being alive. I hate that my life has gotten to this point. I just want to be normal.. I feel so lost and trapped, the nasty thoughts won't leave my head.. please help..",2.0

"A GoodbyeThis is a goodbye. I’m not leaving yet but when I do, you’ll be able to find this. I feel numb, I’ve self harmed for the past 4 years, contemplating suicide for the past 5 years. I’m still very young and I feel terrible for having these feelings. I shouldn’t think this way but I do and that’s the worst feeling. My mom has tried to help me but it never works and my friends don’t worry when I leave school for weeks at a time. They don’t text me unless they need help and ignore me when I reach out to them. I’ve thought of homeschool but I’m nothing without school. I’m nothing. I don’t even go to school anymore and I’m a whole month behind on my work. My brother and cousins all say I have no reason to stay home but honestly I’ve had such a shitty week and have even tried to drown myself in the bathtub just yesterday. But my cousin knocked and said “You’ve been in there for a while did you pull a hannah Baker?” and walked off laughing. My family doesn’t get it except for my mom. They all don’t care and try to pray that I’ll get better but never talk to me. I’m kind of over it. I’ll find a way out.",2.0

"Called out for being quiet/tiredCan anyone relate to this?

Unless I'm being forced into a situation where communication is necessary, I usually don't talk. I find it to be exhausting and can go hours without opening my mouth. Immediately my dad started comparing me, to my extroverted, happier, and louder counterparts like my sister or himself. Most of the time they talk about it behind my back. 

Depression has caused me to become very sluggish too, and I've been called out for that. I eat slow, walk slow, and go at my own pace. The world around me just feels like it's moving slow. 

I just can't be as animated as the rest of my family or the people around me. I lie in my bed all day, my eyelids heavy, feeling unmotivated, empty, lifeless, and curled up in a blanket so that I can waste my life away and contemplate suicide. People need to just leave me be sometimes. Hurts to hear people say all this stuff about you, I really don't mean any harm.",2.0

I’m a transgender man, just turned 22 and has suffered depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember. I was brought up in a very religious household. Where I was taught the Bible and the laws and principles laid out by God.

I have severe gender dysphoria but I can’t make myself start hormones. I can’t lose my family like that. So I’d rather not have to deal with it at all. 

I don’t want to die but I do. I’m suffering so much. I can’t help it and I want to die but I can’t fix myself. I can’t see any other way to stop this pain.

Fast forward a year and now I'm home, she tried again this Sunday when I was over at my girlfriend's and I just didn't know what to do. We hadn't spoken in a while and I didn't know she was upset.

Yesterday night my parents went out 'for a trip' when I was with some friends, she had done it again. I have no idea what to do.

At this point it seems like if we've had 2 days of good positive steps for her to regress back to this then she's lost. I am feeling so jaded from this, I don't know what to do. She's been in hospital all day today and I just don't know what to do.It's all to do with a jerky guy that has moved on from her, she's had bad relationships before and he was equally as bad a person, manipulative and nasty. But since this time we went out for drinks and actually had a laugh, we've joked and hugged and have been relatively normal siblings. My parents are falling apart, they found a letter today addressed to us, it clearly was supposed to be found if she had successfully committed suicide.

"I was severely neglected as a child by my mother, but this isn't about the neglect (although it may make an appearance at some point), I think my twin and I were sexually abused by her first boyfriend (the man she had an affair with). I have a distinct memory of lying in my bed at night and there being a male figure crawling up towards me, this is more of a still frame though. The others however I remember vividly to a point, one was a very inappropriate tickling game where my sister was under her duvet and he was on top of her tickling, except he was also humping, I can't remember much more than that, the other is walking to his house, I remember the exact route, going in and him showing me his house, I can't remember anything once he showed me his bedroom, other than the bedding was white, I don't remember leaving or what happened in between, but I remember things like he had an Eiffel Tower figure he made in his front room. I started masturbating at a young age and I wonder if this is linked in. I've been suffering a lot recently, and I am on medication and undergoing therapy, but these bouts are cyclic, I always end up back in this position after a while, perhaps not as severe as the one I'm in now, but I feel that it's in part due to having such little recollection of my childhood (can't remember much of it or my teen years), I want to be able to have a definitive answer to whether I was sexually abused so I can put it to rest, the not knowing is really hurting and the flashbacks I have are intrusive and upsetting, I don't know how to confront this situation and get over it.",1.0

I try to have an actual conversation with people, usually beginning with small talk, but it ether leads nowhere or someone steals the conversation from me, and I'm flat out ignored.

If someone starts talking about someone or it's about themselves, they usually push me away, saying it's ""girl talk"" or ""I wouldn't understand"" and ask me to leave.

No one is concerned about where I am or what I am doing tonight or where I am going.

No one ever asks me how I'm doing, or what I'm doing, invites me anywhere, or even says hello when I enter a room or goodbye when I leave.

I can't join in any conversation that anyone has, because I know nothing about what they're talking about  (this thing called #YOLO #SWUG, for example) and I would contribute nothing to the conversation. On occasion I can chime in, but I contribute nothing and they usually ignore me.

"I'm Lost.I've been dealing with suicide tendencies since I was in middle school and got picked on and hard a really hard time getting through school and social life. I was in a relationship throughout high school which didn't end well, he was constantly cheating on me behind my back. we were together for 3 years. Met the most perfect guy in m entire life later on after. We started dating in March Broke up around Thanksgiving, but we stayed ""together"". Now when I tell you hes the most perfect guy in the world I mean hes the perfect guy for me, A dj, loves music, has an amazing family who he loves dearly, Made me come out of my awkward shell, Showed me new things, never let me feel judged and could talk to him freely about anything. Reddit hes the man I saw myself with and Idc if i sound like a total freak and he sees This I LOVE YOU MORE THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE.... you know why were not together, because of me I lied to him about STUPID shit. I'd fight about it tooth and nail and I knew i was wrong, i just never wanted to admit to it. He ended everything thrusday, and i've bee fighting with him begging for a chance again, I just feel so lost more than I have more than I felt when I was in middle school, I'm in college failing all my classes but one, I have a horrible job that I hate so much. I deleted my facebook and I can't beleive I'm using my real account but I just dont care anymore. I dont know what to do. I have a therapist and shes helping, I had a long phone call with her yesterday. But that didnt seem to help.

"Can't get over my ex and it's killing me.Our relationship was very much a rollercoaster with high highs and really low lows. She was very abusive, controlling and it made me become jealous and controlling. She cheated on me atleast twice, abused me physically and mentally, she bit me on several occassions leaving huge marks, she pulled my beard a couple of twice so hard a lot of hair came out. She caused scenes at my parents last new years eve, she caused scenes screaming and yelling at me in malls, on trains, at work etc etc. 

I have realised, looking back at our conversations on facebook, i was pretty stupid aswell, accussing her of being unfaithful (which she actually was) but there was no trust and i wasn't very nice alot of times. But that was my outlet i guess. I regret alot of things, i regret even starting to see her because i know from the start it was bad news and i didn't listen, the thought of being with someone, anyone was all that mattered and i really did fall in love with her, i really did love her more than life itself, but i wish i never did. 

It's soon been a year since she left me and i'm not so sure i can make it another year without her. She's constantly on my mind, i miss her every second, i miss the times we shared i miss it all... 

If i only could stop thinking about her but i can't, everyday for almost a year i have thought about her. I can't keep this up, i'm going insane.

I wish i could contact her and talk to her but after she dumped me she cut all contact with me and even threatened me with calling the cops because i tried to talk to her... 

She said she loved me, she promised me forever, she promised we would fight for eachother no matter what... How can someone who says stuff like that turn in a blink of an eye and cut all contact?

I'm not made for this world... I can't go on. One year without her was one year too much. ",2.0

"backed into a cornerI'm in my late 20's and have a few unpleasant medical conditions, including long-standing trouble with anxiety, dissociative disorder and major depression. I also rent from relatives who either abused me or helped cover up the abuse, and circumstances are such that they spend a certain amount of 'social' time around the place. Although the abuse is officially in the past, in practice it means that it's just switched over to 100% mind games and gaslighting. I've tried every feasible way to make the situation work, none of which have made a damn bit of difference.

The hell of it is that this is *already* my last resort.

The local vacancy rate is steady at about 1% and a studio apartment costs most or all of my monthly disability cheque. My health issues prevent me from A) working, B) living with room-mates or C) living without my therapy animals. 

Relocating is also out of the question, since all of my support networks are here and I'm dependant on public transit.  My current city's the only place for five hundred miles where I can get any support and treatment for my physical issues (one of which also happens to be legal grounds for discrimination in most parts of the country).

"help me :(((Okay so last summer i was planning on hurting myself. before doing so i wanted to hurt the people i love. I know... it was just this sick idea in my head to take away or to atleast ease their pain, so they would miss me less when i am actually gone... so i wasnt planning on doing this to every single friend though, i do not have a lot of close friends but the ones i do have , mostly grew up with me and just became like family to me, so there was just no way i could do something to them that would make them miss me less. but there is this one friend that i met only 4 years ago and i definitely was planning to do soemthing to her, so i did..

and we became so close and she meant soo much to me and she's just truly an angel. So what i did basically was sabotaging her online exams and she failed this because of me eventually. at the time i didnt care for it at all, i was actually thinking i was doing something right and i was doing it for her genuinely and i would be dead soon anyways and she would miss me less (so i thought). but the past few weeks made me realize that i should atleast try to ""live"" as i had never spoken to anyone about hurting myself or my feeling until a few weeks ago. and the more i tried, the more guilt i felt and realized the mess i made. so i told my friend and the school everything (we do the same study).

she will pass eventually, our friendship is broken and probably won't get fixed (which i am okay with tho). i will get mental help (something i never thought was something i'd sign up for) and i just want to get better so i will never ever hurt someone like this again. especially someone as special as her, you don't know how much this person has helped me in the past four years.

but now it comes.. it is just so hard continuing, knowing and almost feeling the pain she's feeling. i just hate that i caused someone this much pain and the guilt is also killing me and i do not want to make this about myself but its just soo hard. so i came hear to tell my story and to hear what you guys think. i just dont know what to do next, i do want to become this good person but everything is so overwhelming and exhausting and its truly the thinking thats killing me.

and im tired of my friends telling me that it has happened already, you cant change the past, you did what you could to help her (telling school), youve punished yourself enough . and i know theyre right and i love them and alll their support theyve shown the past few weeks",2.0

"i've lost all my therapy progress so here's a ventI feel like I'm re-living certain early childhood memories as if during usual PTSD flashbacks, they have have triggers, but they're not traumatic memories (although one is suspected to be) and I can't stop thinking about them. I feel like I'm trapped in a loop of thoughts. I remember only tiny parts of it, but I feel a need to try and remember them fully. Why? I don't even know. So I keep trying to as much stuff related to all of that as I can, but I always fail. I feel like my mental health is extremely declining since the start of quarantine since one of my traumas is very heavily medical. I feel like I've become slightly obsessed with those memories, I want to recover them so badly, I have only cloudy fragments and tiny things like music or the place at a certain time that reminds me of that and I just want to cry because this all makes me think of death and how I will never be remembered and all those memories and thoughts will disappear and I just can't take this, the best thing is that I can't get any help and can't get myself to actually tell my therapist about any of this  because I'm too scared she will not take me seriously. I can't call any hotlines since my parents will hear (i live in a small flat) and the wait time for a response to a text message from my local suicide hotline is around 20 days. I start getting easily suicidal and dissociative again, and I feel like I lost all my progress from therapy.

"Manipulation TacticsI'm not entirely sure what I'm expecting to get out of this...it's probably pointless and a waste of time. Maybe writing things out like this is helpful, or maybe it's self-defeating. I don't even know if there's any practical advice you can give me, seeing as how I'm not even willing to share with you how incredibly shallow my perspective is. I hope you can just take my word for it. I'd rather it not go any further. 

Where do people usually start with this sort of thing? Do they ever ask ""why does everyone hate me""? Not meaning to sound calloused, it's just kind of a cliche, and I was wondering if it was true? 

Anyways, the reason I ask is because I feel a little out of place for feeling the opposite. I know people love me. That's why I'm always trying to escape. I'm insincere, two-faced, hypocritical. Most of my social-development involved putting up walls, so I can hardly tell whether I'm honest with myself or not. I think that helps to make me manipulative. I didn't realize just how manipulative I was until my best friend became a drug addict and killed himself. Who knows, maybe I'm trying to manipulate you into relieving my conscience just enough so that I don't kill myself. (I'd probably end up stopping short of suicide to get the sympathy and attention of others so I could feel better about myself.) 

I work, take painkillers and use cannabis for a back injury I got while working. I don't really drink much, though I did for a while after my friend died. I'm also religious and feel so distant from the things I value most. Doubts, fear, frustration, pain, I'm friendless, I've lost all sense of community. I have no future, no hope. 

As these thoughts have eaten away at my conscience, I've been left feeling empty, anxious, and afraid. I just wanted to feel better. I just want to be happy again.

When I drive to work, I look for and debate on the best places to run my car off the road. If I see a gun or a concealed carry, the first thing I think about is suicide. I tell myself every day that I’m beyond the whole “taking action” thing, that I’m not actually going to do anything. But I am overwhelmed every waking moment of my life with these thoughts of dying. And it’s to the point where I’m desperate enough that I might do something about it. But I do worry about my husband. My mom. My brother. They would be wrecks without me. I know I’m loved and cared about (this is not an “easily forgotten” scenario) but that does not override the fact that I want to die. 

Context: I have PTSD from childhood rape/abuse on top of already being bipolar depressive. I have an ESA to help with the crushing loneliness, I’ve done hours upon hours of counseling, and I’ve tried anti-depressants in the past. In high school I was raped at gunpoint and tried to hang myself in the shed later that night. I’ve been cutting for years and have many scars to be ashamed of. I have severe panic attacks where I scratch my hands until they bleed. My most recent incident was carving “failure” into my thigh. It got so infected that I had to visit the ER amid this corona outbreak. They were so overwhelmed that this time I didn’t even get that “are you suicidal” speech from an overly kind nurse. They treated my leg and two hours later I was discharged. 

I don’t like telling people my problems or what’s in my head- they always worry. Worry if I’m eating. Worry if I’ve done laundry in the last week or if they’re still a pile of dirty clothes building on the closet floor. Worry if I’ve showered or if Im sleeping. 
No, mom. I haven’t eaten today or showered, or washed my clothes, or slept. When I weight my life against all of those futile things, which matters more? I’m alone in fighting to still be here and not a single person sees that. Not a single person offers to help. My husband always says he doesn’t know what to do or say to make anything better. But worrying and then doing nothing feels like you’ve already given up on me. And if everyone’s already given up make then... why haven’t I given up on me too?",2.0
"The next couple of days have been mostly normal. A large group of my friends were visiting so I had a good time, but that episode made me slightly anxious every now and then. I have no prior history of anxiety disorder or mental illness. For all I know, this episode could have been anything or nothing, but I do remember feeling a strong sense of anxiety during the tram ride. At the time, I was attributing it to being a little paranoid on pot, so I wasn't concerned - until I started to lose my vision.",1.0

"(NSFW) I have really bad PTSD induced anxiety due to rape situations and being a victim to dozens of emotionally abusive relationships, and I am engaged to a HVAC service technician. One day he was going to do a check up on a furnace, he called before hand and he even gave notice the day before, and I was at school at the time so I didn't see the message till a little later. He walked into the house because the door was unlocked (because some people leave their door unlocked if they're downstairs or something) and he walked into the kitchen and it was a crack house, immediately he had a gun pointed at him and he froze for a second and ran back to his van, the guy shot half a dozen times and hit the rear view mirror, he almost got shot so many times while running to the van, and when I saw this I was hysterically sobbing in the middle of the school hall and when I got home I got to my mom and kept screaming ""he almost died he almost died"" and my mom thought I said he died because I could barely breathe, he seems to be over it now but every time he is a little late coming home from work or hasn't replied in awhile I get so scared hes dead and late at night I can't sleep because I'm scared this is the last day I'll have with him.

I don't care if anyone will miss me. You'll feel bad if I leave. I'll feel worse if I stay. Don't tell me it can only get better if I stay alive. I don't want it to get better. I want to die.

I sit around and do nothing. I can't do anything anymore. My guitars are all rusting. I haven't written anything in months. I don't want to touch anything. I sit around all day and count my mistakes. 

My ex wants nothing to do with me. Neither does her mom. I don't blame them. I hope she can forgive me or at least forget me. I mean she's already with someone so she's doing fine.


I'm in treatment. I have depression (surprise) but in all honesty I don't care anymore. Even when I feel happy I think about killing myself. I don't want to take my meds anymore or talk to my doctor. I want to die. I see no reason.


I've tried killing myself a few times but that was more just getting used to the thought. I'm ready to try something more drastic. Something painless. Something permanent. It'll be like sleeping. But forever. If I could sleep more I wouldn't kill myself. The sleeping feel no pain.

Wife and me got in an argument and she got in my face like she normally does and shoves me around but this time a switch flipped and I shoved her back. She called the cops, I got arrested. 
    
One of the cops is her friend so as soon as I heard his name I knew I was fucked. I can't go with in 100 meters of her. We have 2 kids one is 4 and the other will be one in a few days. I never thought I'd miss my own sons birthday. And I know she is going to make it as hard as she can to see the kids.

I feel so horrible and shitty for our oldest to have to go through this. He loves me so much that the last time we got into a fight and I spent the night away he was having panic attacks that I wasn't there him, now I don't even know when I'll see him next.

I've noticed a really tall bridge by where I'm staying over a river and every time I walk past it I picture myself jumping off. I haven't went on the bridge yet because I know as soon as I do I'll jump.

"Ugly On The InsideHey everyone,

I am writing this because im at a point where im stuck in a constant loop of regret and bad decision making.

I hurt someone i really care about. Not once, not twice, but so many many many many times over the last 2 years. I have caused them so much emotional pain and misery, and quite possibly scarred them mentally for life.

I dont deserve to live anymore. Ive always had suicidal thoughts, and attempted quite a few times (although 3-4 times is when i intended to carry out but failed due to stupid mistakes). I really love this person, but i hurt them a lot. I cant keep doing this. I keep regretting every decision i made and it affects me negativity to the point of making another mistake and hurting them. Then, back to regret and so on. Its the shitty cycle of regret and bad coping.

I want to go through with killing myself tomorrow, away from friend and family. I cant do this anymore. This guilt is eating my alive and is making me more horrible and ugly on the inside. I wish i can turn back time and fix everything, but thats the wish we all want, isnt it. 

I hurt the love of my life. I hurt my family. I hurt my friends and stopped talking to them. I am done with hurting people. I cry almost everyday and its getting harder to breath. Im old enough to know whats right and whats wrong, but i am too stupid to realize it. I act like a baby and rely on people too much. I cant handle one single responsibility to any group project members or family.

To you im just another person whos writing here to vent or to just say a few last words knowing theyre heard before they go away for good. Thats completely fine and thats exactly what i expect.

I am really sorry to have put all the people in my life through this, especially the love my life which saw truly the ugliest sides of me. I put them in so much emotional trauma, i think theyre the strongest person i ever met.

Im done hurting, and i have to leave this world for the betterment of the people in my life.

I've written the final draft of my suicide note on my phone and I can't wait to transfer it on paper. 

No one i know is on reddit, so I guess it's safe here.

Mom, I love you. I ALWAYS have. I was never the child you wanted. I was your mistake you had to carry for 19 years. You'd always let me know how much I was a failure. By ending my life, you'll be freed from your misery. I love you. Now, you're finally free.

Dad, we never had the bond parents had with their children. Our relationship was almost cordial and formal. The only time I see you is passing you while heading to the bathroom. But I just want to let you know that I've always loved you. 

To my friends,
Thank you for being there for me. That you for spending time with me and making me feel like a real, functioning person. I love all of you. I'm going to miss singing and jamming with all of you. I'm going to miss going out, laughing and having a good time with all of you. Remember when we said we would meet up in like 10 or 20 years to see how we've grown? It's not going to happen with me around, but god bless that all the best happens to all of you. I'm sorry for doing this, but this is in the best interest, for the benefit of society, to have one less person who doesn't understand the social fabric of society. A person who brings the storm in the calm of a situation. No one wants to be that guy. It's sad really, but life goes on. We're all going to die and be forgotten, but it will not be in vain.

To my teachers, mentors and academic figures who have influenced my life,
With heartfelt thanks this is my word to all of you. Thank you for imparting the knowledge and thank you for helping me out in times of need. Thank you. 

The rest.. thank you for being there. But I can't be with you anymore.

I wish I could live longer, but I can't feel this way anymore.

"A Story of Survival From A Near-Suicide AttemptMy story starts some time around September. Going back to high school from a summer full of League of Legends and hanging out with friends as now a junior was pretty stressful. I never gave college much thought and didn't care about school too much. I'm pretty smart, able to coast through classes without having to study or anything, just listening in class. My brother went away to college, and so did many of his friends who in turn were good friends of mine. I didn't really get along with many of the people in my grade, so I didn't have many friends left. I have a significant family history of depression, and this was around the time I began to feel my own begin to worsen. For the first time also, I met a girl that I felt I loved. Tried to get things to work, never really did, so that also fed the depression. This spiraled downwards until around three weeks ago, in a deep and dark place, I had a knife to my throat. I still don't really know why, I just wanted to end it all. Escape all the pain that I went through with this girl and what I felt to be a lack of friends. Voluntarily, I admitted myself to a mental hospital for ten days. During that time, I realized how much I actually enjoyed life and the things that I had on the outside. Now, while I still feel somewhat suicidal, I have reasons left to stay, the greatest of which are my friends. I can reach out to them and get help. Now, I'm in therapy, keeping up with my medication. Now, even though I'm miserable at times, I'm still living on the face of this world.
Each day is a gift. That's why it's called the present.

"Don't see any point anymoreFor a while now I've been dealing with depression.

I don't take any meds, though I have had people offer to sell me some. Throughout my entire life I've been in love with three girls. None of them shared the feelings, though. The first one was a very close friend of mine, we haven't spoken in roughly seven years. The second girl was another friend, we still talk and I've moved on, but evertime I see her I get a small pain in my chest. And finally the third girl is a fellow student at my High School. I've refrained from telling her how I feel due to my fear of rejection. Last night a friend of mine, that is also a friend of this girl's, told me that she interested in members of her own gender rather than people like me. Hearing that I have absolutely no chance with a girl that I love made my depression that much worse. I can't stop thinking about ending my life. I've though about the consequences of doing this, but the pros far outweigh the cons. The only thing keeping me from doing it is my fear that I'll fail at it and will spend the rest of my life in eternal pain. Any thoughts?",2.0

"Not sure what I’m still doing..So for around a year now I have been thinking about ending it all on a daily basis. There are 2 things stopping me currently. 

1. The method, I’m not sure how I’d do it, pills seems like the easiest route, however I feel like there is a relatively high chance of survival, and i know that the degeneration of organs and such after a failure by pills can be agonising. I’m in the Uk, so no guns, therefore jumping (possible same end result as pills) or hanging potentially... also considered using my car exhaust. 

2. The prospect that nobody would actually care. This is the thing that scares me the most. I’m not necessarily thinking that nobody would care, just that I feel like I’d be forgotten easily. And that is way worse than death in my mind. 

I tend to be somewhat reckless with my life, praying that something will happen to me without me having to do the physical deed myself. Such as driving too fast, crossing the road without looking etc.. 

I’m not sure how to get out of this situation I find myself in. ",2.0
"It's my birthday, today.First, some backstory.

As of a week ago, we discovered I either have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, or Purely Obsessive OCD.

My, um...girlfriend? Woman I love? Whatever. She's bipolar, and she entered her first really big manic phase about three weeks ago. She's confused about everything, has no idea if she still loves me, thinks she has feelings for other people, the whole shebang.

About two weeks ago, we went on what's supposed to be a break. She actually hasn't been single in about five years, and she says needs time to figure her own disorder out. 

As of right now, she has no idea if this is ""break"" permanent or not. One day she's sure she loves me, the next she can barely stand to be around me. The only thing she's sure of is that she needs at least until fall, apparently.

Needless to say, I was, and still am to some degree, scared absolutely shitless. I have no idea how to handle this situation, and my mind will not just let me relax. As such, in my flailing to fix things, I kept pushing her further away. 

I've finally managed to gather myself together, but I feel like it's already too late. I'm getting the help I need for my own disorder, but I can't tell if her frustrations with me are her manic phase, or legitimate frustrations. I feel like I've already fucked things up beyond repair, and the only things that keeps me going is that she agreed to go on a date this week, and that maybe we'll be back together in the future.

I hate what I am. I hate that I couldn't just calm down, and give her the space she needs.  I'm afraid of what I'll do if this turns out to be completely over. Hell, I'm afraid of what I'll do if I botch this date up.

Edit: It just occurred to me that this date is actually today. I didn't even realize it when I asked her out.",2.0

"I’m 18 and am looking for some encouragement to give this life another try despite all the guilt and mental illnessI’ve wanted to kill myself since I was about 12 due to what I believe to be my mind just not working the way it should. Everything just feels bad and I don’t know how to deal with it. I’ve been hospitalized before and it’s only gotten worse since then. My main problem is guilt, my cousin killed herself years ago and I felt like I could’ve of prevented it, I still feel like I could have prevented it, then my basically best friend killed herself in 7th grade and it’s all my fault. She told me on many occasions that she wanted to or was going to kill her self and I brushed it off and told her to just try to be happy. I was so stupid and I hate myself for it. A couple years ago my grandma killed himself after years of alcoholism and mistakes. I should have loved him more, I should have called him that night, he got in a big fight with the family and I got so mad but I didn’t want this  Another thing is my great grandma lived by herself and basically only my grandma( her daughter) visited her sometimes. She always begged my to come visit and I never did and I mean she really did beg. She died a couple days ago and despite living 10 minutes from her I haven’t seen her In maybe years and now she’s gone. I have always struggled with major depressive disorder and I think it’s becoming too much. I want to give this life another try but I don’t know if I’m good enough too, despite being young I think I might have made too many mistakes. I don’t know if I can be good.

"Confession - I have destructive tendenciesI am depressed for many years and I feel like I should destroy myself completely, or I 'll end hurting everyone around me. It's like I never get a thing done right, I'm always getting in the same circle of bad circumstances. I practiced self harm 10 years, in the high school I used to get drunk every day because I used to think that I'll die earlier, I ran away from home because my abusive father, and years later mom died and I had to let the house, without any belongings. I can't be happy without being afraid that I'm gonna pay for the simple feeling of happiness. I always get attached to people and I always end up disappointed, let down. It's like everyone decided to throw me away. I'm in the same boat with these suicidal thoughts for many years, I didn't had them in a while, last year I was getting better, started to communicate, started to take care of myself. Now, during the circumstances I feel trapped again, I feel the need to destroy myself and to die. I feel like most of my loved ones are being judgemental upon this battle of mine with depression, every little thing they do, it hurts me. I guard myself, I'm always overprotective, I isolate myself and I can't function properly. Part of me wishes to stay, but it's a bigger part of me that can't bare all these issues. I can't have a normal relationship without being belittled, and the last one I had, he told me that I'm crazy and creepy and that I feel way too much. He made me believe that maybe it's true, it's no way out of this. It's so easy for someone to hurt me, it's like I'm not even a person anymore. ",2.0

"Not sure if this is the right place. My Alzheimer's suffering Grandfather tried to kill himself, unsuccessfully. My father (his son) is having trouble. Advice? As the title, I'm not sure if this is the right place, if not, I'm sorry. My grandfather tried to kill himself. He has Alzheimer's, although not super severe (has significant trouble remembering things that happened yesterday, still remembers the distant past well). He recently had a recurrence of bladder cancer (not super life threatening, this is his 3rd time in 30 years with it). He gets angry suddenly and my grandmother has trouble coping. He's also a really big guy, 6'3"" 220 lbs., whereas my grandmother is something like 5'6"" 150. I think in a moment of lucidity he realized how difficult this disease has been on my grandmother. He shot himself, but somehow survived. He even had the wherewithal to walk out of the garage after the failed attempt and seek medical attn. 

My father (his son) has a history of drinking problems. This past year it's been particularly bad. He's had two close family members die (naturally), my mother is not the warmest person to talk to, especially to my father. They've been in and out of the precipice of divorce for years. This year, my mother's father was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, so for christmas she's leaving to go visit her father out of state. My dad could NOT get out of work on Dec 27th, so he has to stay home. After the attempted suicide, my father will now be alone on christmas. To make matters worse (seriously, how could it get worse) my dad's birthday is Dec 26th. He turns 50 this year. At first I was angry for my mom's decision to leave for christmas and my dad's 50th. But I kind of understand after talking to her. Her father's cancer is back strong, so this might be the last holiday she has with her own dad. 

I live out of state (Arizona compared to them in Georgia). I'm now flying back to be with my dad, because I couldn't justify otherwise (despite a heavy workload. I'm in grad school at the moment and am nearing the end of my thesis). 

I'm really concerned about my dad. I know it sounds horrible, but my grandfather was (honestly) a bad person. Like seriously, he did some fucked up stuff to lots of people. He's since turned his life around, but I'm really just concerned about my dad. My dad is angry at his father for ""pulling this kind of a stunt."" I think if it had been successful, my dad would have the same feeling and describe it the same. 

If you read all this, thanks. I really needed to get it off my chest. If you have any advice, esp. w.r.t. talking to my dad, please share. Thanks to whoever read, and please cherish your family this holiday season, regardless of religion. ",2.0

"An endless circle.I live in an endless circle of ups and downs. Just like everyone else. However, I am a master of keeping my mind occupied. I've been living in Denmark my whole life, and to everyone who's naive enough to believe that Denmark is so perfect as the illustration shows - you're wrong. It's a heavily controlled system with a lot of underlying corruption. I have always been more or less depressed and everything I have ever started, I've failed.


I could blame my childhood, that's the popular thing to do; both parents alcoholics, I was thrown from one school psychologist to the other, got diagnosed as a child. My mom cheated on my dad when I was a kid, my dad was in Africa as a teacher and my mom's new fuckbuddy was a pillpopping psychopath. I was unable to ever concentrate in school and got thrown the hell out on boarding school. Got thrown out from that one due to drug abuse and suicidal behaviour, attended a new one for ""kids with special needs"" - only accelerated my drug abuse. 

I finished that shit and got thrown back and forth between my mom and stepdad and my drunk, powerhorny father who I chose to stick with in the end, and I ditched my mom. My dad eventually kicked me out of the house as a teen, while I was starting my first real education. He closed my phone, my cards and everything was gone. I failed the education by the way. However, my mom is sober for five years and I am so proud of her.

Ever since I've been working mediocre jobs without chance of ever advancing, though I believe that my intelligence is sufficient for it. 

Now, I live in Serbia. Yes. In Serbia. Can you believe it? I am trying to obtain permits to stay, and I've been here for two months. I sold everything and left everything behind. 

When that is said, if anyone is even still reading... I am clean, I don't do drugs. I don't drink. I am crazily into fitness, nutrition and bodybuilding and I work on it every single day, yet, I am empty inside. 

But, why are we here? Why is it that we feel disappointed in ourselves and our lives? What is it exactly that we expect? Our parents didn't create us to work or to become successful. They probably made us to experience life on our own and to make of it what we want. We should all stop adopting other people's dreams and lives. 

Just that I am once again, not sure, if I truly want anything out of this. My narcissistic personality disorder helps me look at it the positive way; when I some day kill myself, I will die with abs and a round awesome squat-ass.

"So I've been taking Zoloft for several months and it has been working well for anxiety/depression but I'm having some problems with it. The biggest problem is that my mind feels blank a majority of the time. When conversing with other people sometimes I feel as if I have nothing to say. I feel as if I am less witty, and also less creative. I've backed down my dosage from 100mg to 50mg with some success as I don't feel as 'spaced out'.",1.0

"Need someone to talk to...Hello everyone. Long time lurker and reader, first time poster. I have approached a suicide hotline just to talk, but didn't find it terribly beneficial. So here I am...

Right now I feel alright, but when my mind takes a dive I find myself thinking terrible thoughts and my body is drained of all energy. It has been happening more frequently as of late and is impairing my way of life. A bit about myself: graduated from college december of 2008 and moved back home just outside Detroit. Living in the Metro Detroit area proved difficult as I bounced around a few short term jobs with no sights of something more stable. I moved to DC and worked several jobs before landing a job in a hotel. I don't know what happened or why it happened, but my anxiety began to sky rocket around this time. I worked nights at the hotel and found myself to be terribly miserable and wanted to get out of customer service altogether. To cut the story short I jumped out of DC to pursue an opportunity in Austin as I thought I could do better there. Unfortunately the job was not given to me and I decided not to stay in Austin without a job secured. I am staying with an uncle in California for the moment but I have been hiding my feeling of despair, hopelessness and failure from him. I am applying to jobs in the Bay area but I have really exhausted myself by the search. 

At one point I was participating at a local improv theater and attempting to improve my writing. Gradually my mood changed and I found it increasingly difficult to get involved or even pick up a pen. I need to get back up but i continue to slip and am afraid where this may eventually end. 

Just wanted to talk it out. I want to be happy. I want to get back to pursuing my dreams. My mind says I am not capable of doing these things.

"Fuck this noiseThe last 12 months have been shit. I've been to hospital for physical Illness, I don't find joy in any part of my life, my girlfriend of 5 years left me because she couldn't handle my garbage personality, I've been diagnosed with Bipolar2 which is basically a big sign on my forehead which says 'do not love this person, they are too much effort', My roommate killed herself (most likely because my depressive bullshit got to her), leaving me to pay her side of the rent and I've been fucked working my boring job for money that gets siphoned directly into this house that is only a reminder of how fucking alone I am right now. 

I know everyone says that the pain will fade and I'll build myself back up from this but honestly it hurts too much and I have no idea how to get better. I'm seeing therapist after therapist and nothing is improving. I just want to fucking die, everything is too hard. I have nothing to live for and I spend each and every night crying.

Occasionally she will have really dark thoughts. She is very very good at making sure she reaches out to people about it and always tells me when she has them because she knows it isn’t her and it is her disorder.

No... I won’t live without her. I refuse to.  I am worried to tell her that this fact might make things harder for her, but we promised each other we would always be open with each other about everything, and this is something she made very clear she wants me to be very honest and open with her about (this is because although I do not have bipolar disorder, I have clinical depression and general anxiety disorder and have had suicidal ideation before, almost to the point of actually making plans to, but not quite.)

At this point I royally freaked out and he said the reason he made up the story about driving to the airport was because now that it looked like he committed to attending, it'd be easier to  come up with some urgent non negotiable reason why he couldn't make it (rather than look like a jerk that ditched last minute for something else that popped up without giving any notice). Again understandable. I do buy the story because when the girl called, she told me nothing was going on beyond friendship and that they hadn't talked in forever, she said she herself was busy with a new relationship which why is they hadn't talked beyond simple texts here and there, which would explain why she didn't know he was dating me just until that moment.",1.0

I would feel so upset and just think wow, life would be better if i were to just end it. I would harm myself, scream, cry, beg for attention, etc. It was traumatizing to say the least...

The feelings i feel now are NO WHERE like that.

I'm drowning. I won't say that my break-up had nothing to do with it, because it WAS devastating. But wow. The car payment, the car insurance, the rent, the phone, the job, etc. All of it is so overwhelming. I know it's a part of being an adult but...man idk. 

How am I supposed to balance all my bills, my dog, my job, AND try to go back to school? 

If life is seriously this bad what is even the point?

People can say things get better but i have proof that it doesn't always. i see people in their forties and they don't even have electric. 

I guess what i'm saying is I really don't see the point in living anymore. I don't know if i'd actually do anything, I don't have a plan or anything but, i can't stand thinking about this all the time.

My dad is very uptight and would disagree with any life choice of mine that goes out of the lines of ""Get comfortable money and have a family"". I don't want to marry, I don't want kids, everyone think's I'm mad for these choices but I stick by them.

No one has ever liked me in anything more than a friend spare this one person, they admitted they liked me and I turned them down as I only known them a month and was cautious after a few bad turn outs of getting with guys just thinking it was normal to not feel anything for them at first, to find out they just wanted to use me.

I'm a virgin, it doesn't bother me, I've had offers off drunk guys and the previous guys who just wanted my body. I just need something, anything to cling onto, I don't know anymore.

Life only seems to be a dull mess of no one really knowing what they're doing, people say ""You're beautiful and I love you"" on the internet to try help people in thinking they want to end it all, it doesn't help me.

I just need something. My family have their own lives, I know it will hurt them to go but it kills me silently to stay, I just want to feel like someone.",2.0

I had to withdraw from all but one of my classes due to my inability to be responsible for my work. I don't know if I like my major at all. It's graphic design. I like art, but I feel that my classes are awful for me.

I have a boyfriend, and he loves me, but he's got a very low sex drive. I'm not upset with him for it, but sometimes I feel like I'm not worth being intimate with or something. I don't feel negative with him in any way, just self conscious. It's not his fault.

I'm barely keeping up with the work for the only class that I'm in, leaving things for the hour or two before they're due, sometimes forgetting about assignments.

My family moved with me to this college, despite me picking this one to get away from them. They'd be very upset with me if I dropped out of college. I don't know what I would do if I dropped out. 

I just ran out of money. I'm not allowed to have a job in my first semester, I'll be lucky to be allowed in my second one. I can't go against my parents, they're helping me with some college expenses.

I really want to die so I don't have to deal with life anymore. I know I don't have it as bad as many. It doesn't matter to my brain. 

I don't like my mother or step dad, but I don't want them to be upset regardless. If I died, my boyfriend would probably follow suit. He's casually suicidal.

Well not me of that happened. The only positive thing about my life is that I do have a decent paying job, that I usually enjoy. My life is honestly not worth living. People are disgusted by me.

"I wish i could stop thinking (tw; sexual abuse)I feel like I am surrounded by rape and sexual violence. 

I've not been raped...I think. I blacked out once at a party 2 years back and to this day I don't know what this girl did, but the last thing I recall was her locking the door of the bedroom and leaning into me as I was laying down on the bed having a bad trip and wasted. She then spread varying rumours saying I came onto her and attacked her like a crazy person, even though I couldn't walk. She stalked me online and told people that we were in a secret relationship. It was creepy. So...

I don't know. 

Otherwise, I have been groped at through out my entire life. The other boys in my school when I was only 10ish used to grab at me, and the adults just brushed it off as ""rough housing"", but I know what it was. Children understand more than adults give them credit for. 

I've had girls come at me too, drunk and slobbish. I used to think I was bisexual, but I've never had an experience with a girl that was sexual that I wanted and I think I lean towards men now because of that trauma. 

The one I love was raped in the past multiple times. My friend's ex tried to rape her only a few weeks ago. fuck.

The town I live in now is notorious for rapes. In the new school year over a dozen people were raped on my uni campus. 

We have a dark sense of humour about it though. That's how we deal with it, but it's suffocating how often the subject is on my mind because of how it's in everyone i care about's past and on the news all the time and in films and....

I feel sick. 

I want to stop thinking about it.

I'm going to kill myself, because the isolation is killing me. I haven't ""hung out"" with a ""friend"" in over three years. Nobody has hugged me, told me things will be okay, shown the slightest interest in who I am or my life; so I'm confident I won't be missed.

Also my binge drinking did not help. Found out last night that there is no hope left with me getting back with my ex of 6 months.

No one understands why I would be much happier if i was to leave this world.
1. I would not be a ""debbie downer"" according to my friends and no one would have to worry about me again because what is done is done
2. This will cause all my pain to go away, there is no better medication than to completely forget.

I cannot stop crying everywhere that I am right now; gym,class, walking outside. I just picture my body being battered with each step that I take hoping that the random car thats driving by will slam into me and free me. I cannot make it through the nights without having serious panic attacks and it does not help that I live alone.

"Cannot see a futureHi, new to reddit. I'm a 34 yr old man in the UK, and I didn't have anyone else to turn to, so just wanted to put this out there. I'm not sure why, but I couldn't handle anther night of being stuck in my own head.

I've been struggling with depression and anxiety most of my life, but managed to continue due to achieving the milestones of a normal life. I did well at school, did university and qualified as a doctor. I was getting on with things and from the outside probably looked successful. I got married, and got a mortgage and all that.

But then at 30, I had what I can only term a breakdown. I think it was a combination of hugely antisocial work, a few traumatising experiences on the job, but whatever triggered it, I fell apart. I quit my job, and took 6 months off where I began to feel better.

I then decided to retrain in a less stressful branch of medicine, which I've been doing for the past 2 years. And again, things are going well, had a baby, bought a house.

And I can feel it starting again.

My whole life has been dominated by trying to achieve. But because of this, I've neglected everything else. I've got no friends as when I was breaking down I retreated into myself, started drinking, basically shut down. I have no interests. And hate my job, which is not well paid and still has shit hours.

I had my first breakdown episode at school after a relationship broke down, then had another at university during finals. But I always had family to pick me up.

I first started having suicidal thoughts a few years ago. They became really bad last year, to the point I wrote goodbye letters and practiced hanging myself, but didn't complete.

Now I'm lying here, and can only think of my daughter as a reason to live. I don't like my life at all. I'd happily die in an accident or of an illness, but I'm too cowardly to kill myself. I hope I will die soon, but have a horrible feeling I might live quite a few years more.

I hate university, I'm not failing but I'm close to it, for a couple of my classes. I really just want everything to end. There's a bridge near my house, and every day I force myself not to jump off, because there's a small part of me that is stupid enough to think I'll go anywhere in life. 

I hate myself for being so pathetic, been hung up on the same person for 2.5 years, knowing full well that a relationship there will never happen, cause if I have this much self-loathing it's a certainty that other people pick up on that; or at least they know I'm not a fun person to be around. I have 4 projects due this coming week and I haven't started any of them, but I don't really care. I'm so annoyed at myself, but not motivated to do anything about it. 

For the past few months I've just been thinking about suicide almost constantly. I've told a couple people this and they don't care. Could be they don't believe me, could be they have their own shit to deal with, but probably is cause they see me how I see me: pathetic and not worth the effort. It's no wonder I don't have any friends.

I just want this all to end because fuck this life. Happy fucking birthday to me. Just fuck this all. ",2.0

"Suicide is just calling my name...I’m 18, I cut off all friends, but I have close to no friends to begin with and I cut off all my social medias (no one can track down my name on the internet). Depression has caused this, and nothing is giving me joy like it used to. I don’t even enjoy waking up, I just want to sleep for a very long time. Even if I change my lifestyle like going to school, socializing a little, eating healthy food, and exercising, depression still comes to haunt me at the end of the day. It’s been like that since 12. At this point, it seems like I will have some form of depression in the future. I know it’s wrong to think this way but I’ve read people’s posts of how they had depression since their young teens and still have it as an adult, some up to their 30s and 40s. It makes sense why I would have it at that age. I can’t fucking live like that. This has been the worst year of my life, I can’t even finish high school without fucking up my grades due to intense depressive episodes.",2.0

"Do I need to go to hospital? I attempted suicide and nobody knows.I just attempted suicide a few hours ago. I was overdosing on pills, and stopped myself part way and threw them all up (I counted them all except three, sorry I know that's gross). I then started to beat myself up for chickening out, so I started putting loads of pills in my mouth, but I couldn't swallow them, so just spat them out. I then slit my wrist, bandaged it up and drove home. 

Should I tell anyone about this? Should I go to the hospital? I definitely got rid of all the pills so I'm not worried about my liver, but I'm not really feeling better mentally.

"I just want this pregnancy to be over so I can kill myself without regret.I'm so sick of everything. This gross fucking room. The temper tantrums my toddler throws. The mice that think they own the place. The roomies that have dishes and trash everywhere. The pain of being pregnant again despite being on birth control. The scraping by to keep up with bills just to stay in thousands of dollars in debt. Having to apply for jobs on behalf of my SO because he won't fucking do it himself. My doctors blatantly making it difficult to get sterilized after I give birth for a second time because at 28 I'm ""still young and may change your mind before 30."" Constantly being judged as a mom because I sometimes scream when I cant take it any more. But then again, maybe I am a shit mom becauae even now as my toddler yanks at my hair and hits me with toys I just put away during his shortened nap, all I can think about is how much I just want to die. I try so desperately not to cry around him but I cant hold it in and I know him seeing me this way is damaging him in some way. Its not his fault his shitty mom is like this but hes not old enough to understand that. He just sees me, a wreck and mess, and the only thing really keeping me together right now is the fact that its pretty fucked up to kill myself and leave a toddler alone for hours till his dad gets home and only a few weeks before his baby sibling is born. 

And maybe for most moms having kids to live for is enough but honestly it hurts me more. All my choices and options, even death revolve entirely around what's best for my kids. I'm trapped and lost and angry. I dont want to feel this way but I cant stop it. I wanted 2019 to be a better foot forward. I wanted to be a stronger, happier mother and wife but I just dont have the spine for it. I feel like I'm being crushed alive and no one and nothing can help me. I'm so tired.

I am a victim of war — a refugee in my own country. I was born to a religious family that expects me to stay a virgin until my mid 20's cause of religious reasons.

"I'm shit at titles but I hate my lifeMaybe this isn't the right sub, maybe I should post or cross-post to depression. I don't want to kill myself but I just don't want to be alive anymore.

I've struggled with depression for a very long time. I was abused as a child and eventually kicked out of my home just before college. Funnily enough that's when things got better for me. I started taking Lexapro, I started seeing a therapist, and I met the man that I would eventually call my husband.

We were together for a year and a half, lived together for most of that, before we got married. 

And now, just before our anniversary, he had a mental breakdown. I'm not sure what caused it, we've had marital issues it's true but nothing that we couldn't have come back from. We are just young and we're still learning proper communication tactics and had a lot on our plates.

He looked happy, he acted happy, he was great at ignoring bad feelings but they always built up and ended in a fight. About two weeks ago he had his break. He became increasingly confused and eventually told me that he wanted to die. We got him checked into a psychiatric care facility and he spent a week there. The whole time I kept his family updated on his decline and subsequent progress. Near the end his mother became increasingly hostile. Claiming she was going to take him home and I wasn't welcome. Telling me that I had caused this. I told her that if he wanted to go home without me that I wouldn't fight it. He's sick and needs help that I'm ill equipped to handle.( I would have figured it out myself, and it would have been easier if she'd helped instead of fighting me but I digress.) My husband did eventually choose to go home with his mom. Alone. Multiple states away. I lost the car(his before we married), the house(couldn't make rent without him), and my job( can't get to work without a car). We are indefinitely separated. There hasn't been talk of divorce yet but I'm sure it is eminent. 

So here I am. Podunk Fucking nowhere, no car, no job, no life, no husband, no future, and I just want to turn it all off. I don't want to kill myself, I never formed a plan. I'm probably too much of a bitch to go through with it if I wanted to. But if someone gave me a button that would let me just... stop.

They wouldn't even have to finish the question.

I feel like a five year old. I just want to throw myself down and scream and cry. I want my best friend back. I want my partner back. Of course I want him happy and healthy, but I want him happy and healthy with me. I hate this. I hate this situation. I hate all of this.",2.0
After a few days I start to try to make plans with her to hang out or go out to eat even if its only for an hour or so. She ends up saying no almost all of the time and I'm getting to where I don't even ask because I feel bad that she has to say no. And this leads to me feeling lonely and unwanted. The part of this that doesn't feel fair is that she can ask to do something with me at anytime and I basically drop everything to go do whatever she wants. I say yes to literally every thing she asks because I just cant help myself not to.,1.0

"My boyfriend killed himself three months agoWe were planning to do it together, up until the last few days. I chickened out. He didn't. The second I decided not to, I absolutely knew I would always regret it. And I really, really do. 
I had already had the person who was basically the love of my life, who I was with for about five years, die a little over a year ago of an overdose. I have been struggling hardcore with depression for years, and these deaths of people I deeply love are adding up. 
I don't believe in an afterlife, but I want so badly to believe that I will see them again. Even if I don't...I'm so tired of being in this world. It's not at all fair that they left me here alone.

"There's gotta be more to living than this, right?I feel caught in an endless cycle of abandonment and self pity, and I'm tired of it. A few months back I realized I didn't really have any friends. Sure I have people I get along with, and sports helped, but I feel like the kid that gets picked last in dodgeball all the time. I feel used by my friends. I can't recall the how many times I've hosted for them or lent them money only to be not invited or paid back. My father treated me like shit for years while I watched him raise my cousin in my place. And he wonders why we have a difficult time connecting. 
The one bright spot in my life, my girlfriend, broke up with me 2 weeks ago. Said that she was unhappy and really thought it best to go our separate ways. As much as I didn't want to, I wasn't going to hold her hostage. It wasn't a messy breakup, she did it over text and has refused to even be near me since, but she ceased all contact with me, unfriended me on different platforms, and deleted old posts of me. Everything was good until a week before, we'd been through highschool together, talked about our futures together, I can't help but wonder what I did for her to change her mind so suddenly, but I'll never know, she won't respond to me. After I told my parents, my mom asked what I did to screw it up. No comfort, nothing of the sort, just how was I wrong. My dad made some lame ass remark about how he told me so in the beginning. I went spiralling for a few days and nobody was there for me, even my two closest friends just said sorry bud. I feel so so alone in this world, but with so many responsibilities to uphold. I haven't made a choice on college yet and have no clue what I want to do now.
I got drunk with some guys on Thursday, probably the most I've felt like me in a while, and my dad finds out and threatens to kick me out. At this point I'm so unmotivated to do anything. I drag myself to work every day for what, money that'll be nonexistent in a couple months? I sold my car to buy a new one, but I have enough money now to cover my late expenses. I spent the day hiking alone and calling the people I thought were my friends, asking how their lives are going. Out of the 20 or so people I called only a couple asked how I was. I just finished a suicide letter, but I'm too afraid to read it over. What's the point, in an hour I wont have to",2.0

"I kinda regret not going through with itI've considered suicide a lot in the past, but never went through with it because I thought my death would be causing more issues for them than I would if I just lived.

I was wrong. I'm an underachiever, a lazy bum, and whenever I actively try something, it blows up in my face. I have horrible social skills, am constantly getting sick, look like a fucking gremlin, and can't hold a job to save my life. Issues I have no power to change anything about, and those that I brought upon myself compounded into me becoming a bottomfeeder NEET. 

I stay with family members and mooch off of them. All I literally do for the household is cook breakfast once every other month, but I use their wifi, use their electricity, drink their water, share their food, sleep in their beds, and leech off them like a human parasite. 

I've tried to fix my problems, I've tried to be a useful member of society, but I always fail. I try to get a job, don't make it past the interview. I try something online, it blows up in my face. 

My point is that I caused more problems than a dead man would, which is why I abstained, and family members have told me that themselves also, they've told me that I should just kill myself and be done. 

They aren't wrong, and my current existence can't be called 'living'.

"I have never known real joy.I've never felt happy in my life. Not even as a young child. Certain situations and people made it hard to find any joy in anything. I don't even know what it's like to be happy. I've been diagnosed with depression at 13 but was already wishing to die when I was a lot younger. I still have that wish now, it never left. I won't commit suicide just yet because of my mother but I'm really just waiting until it's okay to do it. I know this is suicide watch and I'm probably only allowed to post if I'm actually about to kill myself but I'm just posting this to.. I don't even know. I need something. Anything. I can't live like this anymore. I don't know what I'm looking for really but I know I've always had this emptiness and its freaking eating at me. I feel hollow. Dead. Numb but at the same time feeling too much at once. I'm angry, I'm depressed, crying and silently screaming. The only thing making it bearable is selfharm but even that is getting too dangerous. I can't do this anymore. Why can't I just be someone else. Anyone else but me. I hate myself. Always have. My head is Hell. It's that bad. I'm only 25 but I've been wanting to die from really young, about 8 or 9. I've been in a constant state of severe depression for over half of my life. I should be having the time of my life, being young, wild and free. Instead I'm locked in my own head like a prisoner. I've couldn't enjoy my young childhood, I was devastated and suicidal during my teen year and now as a young adult I feel like a shell with nothing in it.

If only I didn't love my mother, then I could've ended my life years ago. Just a tiny razor, a few minutes and everything would finally be over. Instead I have to wait until my mother passes away so that she doesn't have to know of my suicide. It would kill her. But waiting is killing me. It keeps getting worse every day.

"I've began to plan out my final daysI've decided that January 8th will be the day I leave this earth. I began writing my suicide letter today. I'm not an amazing writer so this is hard for me. But I figured I would just speak from the heart and get started early because I have a lot of people I want to write to. I want to spend the last few days doing things that I love and spending time with those who love me. I love going on bike rides, boba milk tea, watching studio ghibli movies, and playing guitar; therefore, I'm gonna spend the next week doing all of those things lol. On January 8th, I plan on deleting this account, printing out my letter, eating one last dinner with my family, and then heading to where I'm going to do it (I don't want to do it at home because I don't want my parents to find me). I think I've kind of come to terms with my impending death. I don't know if any of you have seen the new Pixar movie, Soul, but it really opened my mind to the idea that your purpose in life is what you make it. I've found purpose in my friends, family, and the small things that have made me happy. I think I would be doing myself a disservice by continuing to keep living knowing that my depression will only worsen as time goes on. With that being said,  I thank you all for your kind words and messages. Seeing your guys' posts on here really made me feel like I'm not alone in this. I've lived 19 full years. I've had my ups and downs, but overall, I'm thankful for the time I've had here. Depression is a bitch and I hope you guys can all get over this hill. Unfortunately, I'm not as strong. I'll probably make one more post on here before I pull the plug, but if not, it's been a pleasure :).",2.0

"""Hey man, how's life."" A text from my friend on the 5th I never got around to replying to. Found out today he killed himself in his dorm room.I met him while working at a local grocery store.  He was one of my favorites to work with because he was a hard reliable worker and we always managed to get on wild tangents of conversation that made the day much more enjoyable. He was just finishing up his senior year in high school where he was one of several valedictorians and worked until later in the summer when he left to study chemistry.

One of his last days at work he came over to my house and I dumped something around 10 gigs of music on his computer for him to help with all the kicking ass he was about to embark on at college.  He seemed so thrilled to be starting this new chapter of his life, and I was happy for him.  He was so logical and mature for his age but still so young and naive.  He would often ask about my college exploits, the parties, the girls.  I didn't embellish the details and was rather blunt about my over the top approach to life and my struggle with alcohol.  I tried my best to be a mentor of sorts and pass on some of my hindsight and experience.

I have no idea what lead him to take his own life or what clues he may have been leaving in how he lived his last days, weeks, or months.  We only caught up randomly once in a while and the news from him always seemed to be of wild enthusiasm and enjoyment, perhaps a clue in itself.  He did have a lot of built up sense of incomplete social goals having been so dedicated to school. 

I worried he might be going a little hard on the partying, but I and so many others of us did the same thing in college. 

It hurts wondering if he was reaching out to me with that last text message... I know he was in some way.

Any of you out there struggling please realize that no matter your misery, embarrassment, loneliness, or anything that compels you to think in terms of suicide, people care about you and are willing to help you as much as they can.

**TL;DR** Please keep yourself alive reddit.  People are around that can and WANT to help you. Your life matters and things get better.

This is my first post in this sub. I'm quite new to reddit so please excuse me if I make etiquette mistakes.

I've been severely depressed for the past 3/4 years. I'm not sure I'm ready to go into the details in public. I talked about it with a therapists (CBT) but didn't help much. My friends are too selfish to actually give a damn and they only lean on me when they need something.
What makes me even more depressed is that I don't have any serious reason to be so down. I have two kids, a good job (actually a dream job for million of people), but I don't love my wife anymore and I feel completely empty inside.
I've always been very sensitive and now I feel... Exhausted. Everything throws me over the edge and something that happens yesterday left me in a terrible state. I couldn't get out of bed the all day and only now I've been able to pick up my tablet to write this post.

I crave love. I need love.

I've always been drawn to the star crossed love stories and in fact the one with my wife started that way: impossible, intense and cursed.
We made it worked, got married and then.... It basically finished.

I'm 40 and I feel my life slipping away. I don't see any future and I'm not killing myself only because of my kids.
There is.... Someone.... Another star crossed love story... She makes my hearth beat again... but I can't have her... No matter how much I think about it there is no solution.
I live in London and the tube trains are starting to look very... appealing. They seem to be the easiest solution.
As I said I know it's stupid and most people would kill to be in my shoes.

"Therapy failedKinda new here, think I've posted before in the past but so long ago that I dont remember the account. 
So.. it's really a long story with so many little details that I just cant be bothered writing. I'm tired. The short of it is that I've fucked my life and I'm too lazy or defeated or something to repair it. I dropped out at 14 (24F now), isolated, spent the last 10 years in a sinking ship of suicidal depression, ruining my body with self harm and an eating disorder. And now its like.. my brother [44M] hung himself last Oct and my family is all on their own sinking ships too. His kids/my nephews [8, 10, 12] are with his predatory sociopath (not said lightly) of an ex wife and are getting fucked up and my parents are going through another legal shitstorm with her. And idk I'm just on the outside looking in at everything .. and everything I see I don't really want to be part of anyway.
Like what even is the point lmao.
I did a year of DBT skills group and I'm still in ongoing individual contact and it's been relatively successful. I'm totally different than I was a couple years ago. 
But here I am feeling sick, probably with covid, and all my distractions at trying improve myself (electrical engineering course, gym, trying to make friends) have been stopped for at least the next 4 weeks because my country (NZ) is shutting down. And I'm looking at my messenger with a handful of randoms I hardly know in real life not knowing who to even talk to. Fuck being alone this long. 
And what has my mind gone straight to? Looking up how much codeine will do the job even though I KNOW od is one of the worst most bullshit ways to go.

"My family are keeping me alive.My name is David. I am almost 18 and from the UK. My depression started when I was bullied by not only students but teachers as well in my early teenage years. I started feeling better about life after I got a new school and a new girlfriend. This didn't get rid of the depression, just made it easier to handle. (The bulling continued)

Recently however my depression has kicked in full time. It is currently 3am in the UK and I cant sleep without the thought of killing myself. The reason for this is a lot of things piled into one outburst. I have been bottling everything up for months just to keep my family happy. They are all I have, now anyway since my girlfriend broke up with me and blocked me on everything she had me on. This alone was enough to bring back my depression but not enough to want me to kill myself. She was everything to me. While I was still unhappy when I was with her because of unrelated reasons just seeing her could make my day and watching her leave was heartbreaking.

At this time I was going into college and the first couple months were fine until I realised I was an outcast. I was that person in the corner with his head in his hands for two hours just waiting for his next class. No one would come talk to me, no one wanted to see if I was okay. They all gave me the same look. Like I wasn't even human. My therapy was at this stage and that didn't help.

The reason now is because I know for a sure fact that I am a waste of space. Everything I do to try and help other people or myself for that matter just ends up in me fucking things up even more. I have poor grades and have 0 talents. There is no hope for me. I have tried to get a job but no one wants to hire a sad act kid with autism. My biggest achievement in life is getting Diamond on League of Legends for Christ sake. I'm pathetic. 

Everything just keeps get more and more difficult and the only thing holding me back from suicide at the moment is my family. I love them and I cant put them through the torture after I am gone but on the other hand I am dragging myself through hell knowing full well there is no hope for me becoming anything successful. All just to keep them happy. Is it worth it?

Please help. I feel dead inside and I don't know how much longer I can last until I make up my mind.",2.0

"I'm a spoiled little brat who thinks the smallest inconvenience means it's all overEveryone on here, in the mental hospital I got checked into, on other depression forums make me realize that *holy shit* I have it easy. My parents are funding my freshman year as a computer science major at a respected university that was my *fall back* school and I'll skate by in thanks to my 37 AP credits and above average intelligence. I'll have no problems here thanks to my tall, able body with a strong immune system and no chronic diseases. My loving family's only demand is that I stay in touch with them so they can tell me how much they love me. I'm making friends really easily here. Only a month in and I've got several circles where people seem to really like me. I see people copying my jokes, laughing at anything I say, and enjoying talking to me. My biggest problem right now is how tiny my iPhone 5's screen is to type this out since I don't feel like grabbing my expensive MacBook Pro my parents bought me. Damn. I have a really good, solid life.

So why does it all hurt. Why do I feel so much sadness. How come I got bullied today on the internet and my reaction was ""I should kill myself I'm so worthless"".

I don't have any romantic or social life to speak of; and I'm wasting my time in college.

I used to think that I would never commit suicide. Each day wears me out more and more; and I feel like I'm reaching some sort of threshold. I'm still deeply uncomfortable with suicide; but I find myself thinking about it increasingly. 

I just want to not be miserable. I don't want to be gay. I don't want to be an unsuccessful, lonely, loser.

I keep thinking maybe one day, I will be happy; but things look so bleak now. I'm just disappointed with the way my life turned out.

I would ask what I can do to start enjoying life, but I feel hopeless. Suggestions are welcome anyway.

That just made me want to go hurt myself all over again. I felt as if I'm wasting everyone's time and I'm merely a burden (which I felt prior to my attempt).

"I just can't do itI have every reason to take my own life, but I can't.

My girlfriend dumped me out of the blue. I thought we were happy, so it was a huge slap in the face.

I'm stuck in a religion that I don't believe in because I'm too much of a wimp to break my family's collective heart and leave.

I have no self-esteem, just looking in a mirror is enough to make me depressed.

I have no aim or goal in life, I'll probably end up working the same job for years with no end.

All my friends are happy and attractive and satisfied with their lives but I'm just not.

It all comes down to the fact that I'm just too much of a pussy to off myself, which makes me hate myself even more. It's just a vicious cycle.

I just wish, everyday when I wake up, that I would've just died in my sleep or dropped dead one day. Every single day and every single second. I hope that happens soon because who the fuck would even care. The people I love the most don't even like me anymore. I was honestly better off as a baby or a toddler, at least I was cute and quiet.

"My parents are causing my suicidal thoughtsBeen suicidal for almost 4 years. I’ve been cutting myself for over 2. Just recently told my parents about how I was suicidal and I’ve been cutting myself. They told me that I should stop acting and be a man. They told me I was cutting myself because I was “trying to get attention” when my top priority was to not let anyone know. That’s why I kept it a secret for so long. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I feel suicidal everyday, but I don’t really have a plan or thought on when and how I will end my life. I just want the pain the end. To be happy again.. One of the main reasons why I’m suicidal is because of my parents. They’ve been abusive to me for almost my whole life. Hitting, kicking, screaming at me. My parents argue and drink almost every night. Then my mom blames everything on me. Saying that it’s my fault that she is arguing with my dad WHEN MOST OF THE TIME I WASN’T IN OR PART OF THE CONVERSATION!!! Sometimes my friends can hear my parents argue. They ask if I’m okay and if they should call somebody. I told my parents to quiet down so that nobody asks anything. Then my mom started saying that if they call the police or anybody, it would be my fault. Then she started taking it out on me. Telling me that I’m a failure and that I am an embarrassment because I was suicidal. For all my life my mom told me that if I tell anybody what my parents do to me, then I would be taken away and sent to a new home. When I was younger I was scared of that thought and I didn’t want to leave my parents. But now that I’m older I feel like it would be better to get away from them.

People classify you nowadays as ""profitable"" or ""useless"", they simply consider anything as an investment... and don't get me wrong, that's totally fine by me .
What's not, for instance, is the fact that I grant too much trust on people who dont deserve it, just to see that generosity grow on their greedy faces and become venom they spit on your neck whenever you show any form of vulnerability ...
People want to debunk your success, and try to convince you that you're a heavy weight they are obliged to put up with ... making it all seem like a huge favor ... but guess what ... you don't need/want that 
You don't need the moon to guide you just because it's dark as it will fade by dawn and only the campus you carry will help you reveal your path to unleashing your true potential ...
Just be the outcast and live by your own rules and let your reward be what you truly seek in life and not those who surround you, greedy retards who keep on nodding their heads in front of you and talking trash behind your back, and keep on hoping that tomorrow will be better and that the future you, will collect eventually the reward of your sacrifices ... keep on holding on to that dream ... while gripping to life before diving into your storm of thoughts",2.0

"25, no friends, no job, no degree, no real will to live; I'm just bad at suicideAs per title. I'm tired of shitty side-effects from medications that seem more-or-less randomly prescribed, and I'm tired of fighting even to make appointments with psychologists/psychiatrists whose hands are tied because they're working in under resourced systems.

I've 'attempted' at least twice, if you can call my shitty attempts at hanging actual attempts. I say at least twice because I've been involuntarily hospitalized twice, one time the police were sent to my door. All the hospitals do here is hold you and pump you full of drugs, there's no therapy, no plan post-release, it's a complete crap-shoot. All they've done is teach me to never talk about suicide with therapists or anyone who knows where I am, which I guess is what they want because that way I'm consuming fewer resources.

I'm just a drain on society that needs to go away.",2.0

"I had a fantasy this morningI'll start with why I'm here. I broke my wife's heart. She's an amazing woman that deserves not a single ounce of sadness, and I let her down. On a lonely night while she was gone I found some intimacy on a webcam site. I don't know why I did it, but I felt sick about it after and confessed. It happened a few days ago. I confessed yesterday after she was telling me how perfect she thinks I am. I couldn't take it anymore and here we are.

As I was walking into work this morning, I saw a stranger across the street on the sidewalk. I fantasized that they would pull out a gun and rob me, and I'd do something stupid to get myself shot. I don't think I could pull the trigger myself, but I keep coming up with these ideas to get myself hurt or killed where it wouldn't be an obvious suicide, so she could still get life insurance. Maybe I ride my motorcycle without a helmet down some bad roads. Maybe I go kayaking in some rough water and don't secure my life jacket (I skipped a paddle trip tonight just in case I wouldn't be able to fight those thoughts). Even as I'm writing this, I'm afraid it could be found should something happen and keep her from getting insurance.

I've never had a single suicidal thought before today. I'm not even sure if I really am, but I thought it would be good for me to come here. I can't take hearing any more about breaking her heart or letting her down. She said she never thought I could hurt her like that. I just feel even worse for thinking about doing something that would hurt her more.",2.0

"Makes me sadder than I already. Im so numb right now, I wouldnt care if I suddenly just died for all of eternity, unaware of anything but nothingness itselfI do drugs like magic mushrooms and marijuana to feel any kind of happiness. When on neither on these, I am a hollow shell of a human. Empty, numb; and tired of everything. Including eating and breathing. So much effort, so much tedious activities just to stay alive for another day—week etc. When really, I know deep down inside, that I will just die some day, without an afterlife or reincarnation of any kind to redeem or console me. Just utter oblivion. Devoid of all my senses, memories and even consciousness. 

It doesn’t help that when I feel good. I feel really dramatically good. At ease. Comfortable and oh so alive—just to plummet back into despair and depression. I am quite sick of this sickening cycle. Maybe there’s something to this sick game/charade of life and constant effort. Something that hasn’t clicked yet. And that’s my main reason for not offing myself; I want to figure out this mess. To find a reason to stay alive. Sure it’s got to be more than just drugs and dreams.",2.0

"I feel so terrible.I wanna end it again. The urge is coming back. I feel it creeping over my shoulder whispering in my ear telling me I need to die. She's gotten in my head again. This morning I mistook my own mother for her and just snapped. (She dies this to mess with me every day) She's everywhere I go, is there every time I try to kill myself (I've tried 22 times), everytime I try to cut (over 1000), laughing, staring, nagging, calling me names, telling me to end it, telling me to harm myself, saying I'm not worth anything, reading over my shoulder, giving her opinions about every single event in my life, coursing me into making terrible decisions. I don't have one moment of peace, one moment of relaxation, one minute to think or zone out because despite my best efforts to block her out to kill the halluncatuons and the voices, she is always there everyday to tear me down and destroy any progress I've made. I thought it was torture before. I thought it was bad. Terrifying even. Sometimes she would try to kill me. Others she would simply abuse me physically. Despite her not being there being there I still felt all the pain, or I would just get super back flashbacks and intrusive thoughts of past events I've tried to forget. But, today it happened again (the worst one yet) I was sitting in my basement and had a complete panic attack where I spazzed out on the floor. She had her hands around my throat and squeezed. I felt like I couldn't breathe. I honestly felt myself losing consciousness. I thought I was going to die. I think I may have passed out for awhile because my dad woke me up. (I came up with some excuse about me being tired) I've tried distracting myself, I swear I've tried everything possible to manage it. The hallucinations, the voices, my BP Depression. Everything. Nothing works. She always comes back. I can't defeat her. There's no point in trying anymore. I've run out of energy, I don't have the fight.

I was thinking of attempting again tonight. The only thing keeping me from doing that is one of my friends. He's been there for me more than alot of people I know. I can't lose him and he said I'm all he has rn. I don't want to abandon him. But, I can't deal with this anymore. Not him hes amazing and I'm thankful to have met him. But, the voices, the hallucinations, the flashbacks, the fainting, the BP Depression. It's to much. My parents wanna pump me full of medicine for the depression and expect me to just smile and be ok 24/7 I can't do it. I can't do this anymore.

"Here and back again.Last time I posted here, it was about me being curious of death and thinking of suicide, even though everything in my life was good. Well, now everything isn't good. The love of my life that I spent five and a half years with has recently told me that she doesn't love me anymore, and that she hasn't been happy in a while. Now, I had always been really good at telling how she had been feeling, and I can tell you that she got really, really good at pretending to be happy to fool me.

Since then, I've had trouble keeping up at work, my bills have fallen behind, and I'm noticing that all of my friends are entirely too selfish to help me out. I have many friends, but the only one that ever really knew me was her, and though we are trying to be friends and I am trying to talk to her, every moment that I do I start to feel worse and worse.

I have some short-term goals I would like to see through, such as finishing my novel (and perhaps the sequels). But beyond those, I see no reason to keep going. I believe it was George Eastman, inventor of the roll film, whom, before ending his own life by gunshot, left a note saying ""My work is done. Why wait?""

I have lost trust in people, I have lost a part of myself (since I couldn't 1. see she was unhappy and 2. do anything to stop it), and can no longer see any of my future, since it was planned out mostly with her.

"Promised myself to try to get my life together next yearMy life could be worse right now, but it still could be better. I think 2017 has been my worst year so far. As an 18-year old girl i'm confronted with the 'career choices' topic, which is very difficult for me. I still don't know what job I want to do. (Well, actually yes, I want to be a photographer or an author, but it's difficult to reach that goal if you don't have enough motivation. And i'm not even sure about these options.)
I have anxiety and depression phases for 3 years now and i'm still fighting against them, without medication. 

But it calms me when I think, that I made it so far. So I chose to try to stay alive another year. 
I don't want to loose this battle without a fight. 

I even told my therapist, that I want to try meds, because I just feel that talking doesn't really help (My biggest problem is that I can't start things. I want to do stuff, but I just can't. It's like i'm tied up to my bed.) She gave me an appointment with the doctor , so he could find out if meds are necessary. 

I really wanted to avoid meds, but none of my problems can get in my way right now. 2018 is going to be a very important year, and if I don't get my life together then, I never will.

"Suicide due to my situationI want to start this by saying this is no way for attention, I just can't talk about this in my situation because I'd be put on literal suicide watch hence why i'm talking about this here.

I've been in the us army for a good amount of timing and am currently getting discharged and I've never felt like killing myself more than i have right now. The embarrassment of being chaptered out even if it's honorable hurts me a lot. I could lie to people about why but the fact was i suck at running no matter how much i tried i would always struggle and trained enough to where it actually made my run time a lot worse. The biggest reason i'm considering suicide is because my mindset is im getting chaptered because im a failure. I've been told that i should not beat myself up about this and i have a good head on my shoulders. But it's so hard to keep lying to myself. When i get my ""honorable"" discharge I want to kill myself but I'd also hurt my girlfriend i've known for 6 years now. she has known i am very self destructive but she also knows i want to always be there for her even though our locations and work schedules make it so we have little free time to talk to each other.

Now i can’t have a normal relationship with anybody and I’m stuck in my fucking head and have recently averted my attention to drugs. I don’t have a job i dropped out of college and now I’m alone in a shitty town by myself in this god damn apartment. I just think maybe today is the day I’ll actually just do it. I hate to admit it but i don’t care about how it makes my family feel. I feel genuinely uncomfortable being alive and being here. A week before my cousin killer himself i told myself i would and now i wish i did it first. He would have seen what i saw and he would have reconsidered. I would rather him be here rather than me because at least he had good things going for him. I’m literally just a failure. Therapy did help me in the past but I’m fucking broke as fuck and can’t afford those types of things.

"I have a baby on the way, and I keep getting very intense impulses to end my life.I would say that in my early to mid teens I was incredibly suicidal. I came very close and sincerely did not want to be alive, as I was very fat and had a very unhealthy social life. Around 16 I made new friends and discovered reddit. My passion for science was catalyzed and life grows increasingly sacred to me every day. I would never kill myself because as an Atheist I think this is likely the only chance we get. Which is why I am here. I do not want to die, but I'm afraid if I just happen to be in the wrong state of mind I won't hesitate to cut an artery or drive off a cliff. It's like a sudden impulse where I just want to smash my face into a wall or imagine me killing myself in some brutal way. The impulses are getting much worse this past week and I have no one to talk to about it. The worst part is my girlfriend is almost 3 months pregnant. I'm excited to have a baby and I want to be a good father, but I know she doesn't love me. She doesn't like it when I kiss her or touch her. If I suggest sex she gets mad at me. She just doesn't care about me at all anymore, it's like I'm just a hassle in her life. I have one good friend who only hangs out with me because I'm his only friend. My siblings have all threatened suicide to me in the past few years and I feel like I would just be begging for attention if I told them. I don't have insurance and I have spoken to medical professionals concerning this and they say there is nothing they can do because I don't have a real plan. I really want to be alive for my future baby and I want to help fix the oceans, I just need some help shaking these feelings. Maybe someone who has felt the same can tell me how they got passed it.

"Should I leave a suicide note?Would anyone even bother reading it? Nothing I say would change anyone's perspective. My family and me are just stubborn people. They don't take blame, apologise and think their opinion is always right

This is pretty weird but I've been waiting for some massive argument that will leave me so negative and frustrated to muster the courage to suicide. I failed my driver's knowledge license on the first go whereas my siblings all passed. I got into an argument with my mother. But just moments before that she was telling me how much she loved me then next thing you know I'm ugly, worthless and stupid. Nothing surprising. She also talked about how her childhood was so miserable and other kids are better. Which isn't false btw she did live in poverty in vietnam. Then proceeded to talk about my personal things to my relatives.

But the difference is I don't want a life even if it's good by society's standards. I have bad social anxiety being near other people disgust me. I never hold eye contact, physically touch others or speak. But according to everyone I'm blessed with a normal body so they ask what's wrong with me, why am I such an ungrateful brat? I can't just go out there and voila I'm extroverted and happy

Pretty sure if I write a suicide note it'd be full of bitterness. It wouldn't leave anyone feeling guilt, my family doesn't like me and take others sides. So....would anybody want to try to attempt to give me half\-hearted reasons on why life is worth living?

"In Need of Advice, I Did Something Really Bad and Will Probably Go to Hell for It.Before I start,  let me say I'm a 19 year old female who has my own suicidal thoughts. Which only makes this situation worse. I'm sorry if this post isn't allowed. 

My littlest sister is 13. She's attempted suicide before and I'm very glad she's alive. I stayed with her in the hospital for the first week until I was forced to go back to school. 

I live with my grandmother and two of my three sisters live with my mom. It's Easter vacation and I came to visit. Things were great the first few days,  but then for the past two days both of my sisters have been really mean to me. Saying I'm not allowed in their rooms, that I smell gross right after I shower,  saying I'm a slob even though I've been picking up my trash,  etc. Just making me feel really unwanted. 

So today my littlest sister and I got in an argument and I kept getting angrier until I told her I wished she'd died in that hospital and that she'd kill herself. I regretted it as soon as I said it and went to shower and cool my head. 

I'm not excusing my actions because as a suicidal person I know what I did was wrong and it was evil of me to do it. She's currently in my other sisters room crying. I did apologize,  but I know sorry doesn't change anything. 

Yesterday I decided I wouldn't visit again since they clearly don't want me around, and now there's no way that'd change given that I just told a suicidal person to kill herself. 

But I wanted to know if there's any advice on making things better. I leave on Friday and I'd at least like to let her know I didn't mean it if there's a way she'll believe me since I doubt she believed the apology.",2.0

As a result, I sometimes feel people hang out with me out of obligation now, because I can't fathom why anyone would like to be around me anymore. 

Last night, I told my best friend I'm going to be out of the country for a year, and made no big deal out of it. He started crying. Fuck, I wonder how he would feel if went away for good.

"Inpatient care, good or bad idea?Main point: I've been doing a lot of research into suicide options, they all seem pretty risky and some are just damn expensive. My health insurance will cover mental health inpatient services for a $500 copay. Has anyone admitted themselves into a mental health facility, how did it pan out? I'd rather not waste $500 (borrowed) if it's not going to do much. I don't expect a miracle, AT ALL. But the therapists I have seen are almost embarrassing with the information and advice they provide me. 

Backstory: It's been about 10 years since my depression came on, 5 since it started to get really bad, and 2 years since I've become very serious about suicide. I've seen 6 different therapists (4 of them moved away, 2 of them just did not work at all.) I'm currently trying my 10th antidepressant and I'm just at my wit's end. I live alone, which is a terrible time in itself. I lost my job 2 years ago and I cannot afford to live right now. I've tried for a very long time to find a new living situation, and aside from living in my car, it's just not working. I have 3 pets who I love more than anything in the world, and for the past year I have been trying and failing to work out some medical issues with them. 

Parents, family, friends, co-workers are all very uninterested in helping with support. They say they are here for me but when I need them the most ""something comes up."" I've told them about my fears of suicide and this is still their response. I really would rather not go through with suicide. I have upcoming obligations, I'll soon be becoming the guardian of my brother, and without me, he will be sent away. Even knowing all of this and trying not to be selfish with so many suicidal thoughts, I can't help but think that this condition is never, ever going to go away. I've tried so many things. 

I don't know what to do anymore. It's getting to the point where I'm ready to get it over with at the dumbest things happening because I just kind of cant handle it anymore.

I'm really sorry this is so long, I hate bothering people with any of my bullshit. I've just heard so much mixed information about inpatient treatment and I'm so lost dammit. So if you've gone through these treatments, I'd really love to hear how it worked out for you is all I'm looking for I guess.",2.0

I know people do and I should feel lucky but I feel so miserable. I have to study for finals right now and I just can't. Someone I really cared about just stopped talking to me. Usually, I push them away, but this time I held back all of my neurosis, used all my coping skills to stop anxiety and stop jumping to conclusions. This time someone I thought I was safe with and told me that if she wanted to stop talking to me, she'd tell me decided to ghost me. It feels like no matter what I will be left alone. And I want to do anything but that. I should be in the hospital. And I sort of want to be in a hospital so I can just cry all day, but my college sucks with the policy on this. If I end up in the hospital they won't let me back for a year, after all my friends graduate, and I won't last without friends. Before covid, I wanted to push through and graduate then just fall apart for a few months. I am thinking about just ending it. I don't want to be me, I would trade everything I have or would ever have material or personal qualities just to not be so scared of being alone. Usually, I feel good knowing that I am more considerate than a lot of other people. Not in a holier than thou type of way but just I think I'm a good person. Well what has that got me. I try and be considerate of others feelings and just get hurt. I am so angry but I don't have the guts or will to hurt anyone else emotionally (definitely not physically). So I feel like I want to die to spite everyone. My parents who beat me and pressured me and made me so scared of being alone, the people who have abandoned me, and the people who have used me. I stopped thinking about how it would make my parents sad if I died. I know it would, but I want them to be in pain because my parents made me this way. I just don't want to be alone. If I am dead, I won't ever have to worry about that ever again. I don't care if I'll burn in hell. I don't believe in it and I'll take that chance that it doesn't exist.

"What does it all meanYes, what is it? It.. It seems like a huge mystery. The more one strives to solve it, the more it tangles, until it finally becomes insoluble.

I know you are in pain right now, but if I had the magical power to rid you of your pain, how long would your happiness last? How long would mine last? It seems there is no peace as long as we live in this cursed world

One moment crying and the next laughing. One moment laughing and the next crying. Man is a pendulum that oscillates between happiness and sadness, said a poet once. But what if schopenhauer is right? What if man is like a pendulum that swing backwards and forwards between pain and boredom. That is surely worse

But what is worse? Or good or bad. These are all relative, aren't they? If they are all relative, then maybe what I feel could become better. If only I could change my mind... How to be a stoic in 10 steps.

Oh aristippus, how could anyone in one's right mind not laugh at your words overshadowed by epicurus. I agree with nietzsche. As he says in the gay science, only someone who's suffered a lot in life can be like epicurus. He must have suffered a lot to reach his satisfactionist solution.

To be or not to be, that is the question. I love you hamlet, at least you are much smarter than most comfortable people of this modern age. I sometimes cannot help thinking maybe evolution is operating backwards nowadays. Seriously, how many people realise this question? To be good, to be evil, I can tolerate them. But stupidity... No.

But maybe it is the best not to realise at all. Theognis of megara... The best of all things is something entirely outside your grasp: not to be born, not to be, to be nothing. But the second best thing for you is to die soon.

I sometimes feel like I am actually ill. A feverish illness. And after a while my mother will come and jolt me out of my dream. No, that is too good to be true.

Is it wrong to find comfort in dystopias? When obrien says reality is in human mind winston, many shiver but this makes me hope. If it is in human mind, maybe... Maybe we could change everything with only effort of will. George berkeley, who would have thought your absurdity would give hope.",2.0

"I'm getting close to hurting myselfFor the longest time, I never thought I could do it. I've lived with a growing depression for years, and I've always just bottled up my anger or sadness. I used to have martial arts as an outlet, then music, and now nothing. I've admitted to my parents, before, that I've had suicidal thoughts. I could never see myself actually committing suicide, but those thoughts still come and go often. It's more prevalent now due to so many circumstances, many of which I can't personally change. I'm just drifting through life, waiting to die; I'm only 23 and I feel like I'd rather just fade away. Now, the only midway point is to cut myself. At least then I'd feel something, no one at work would even notice. It's the only thing that acknowledges those suicidal thoughts, without committing to them.",2.0

I have taken medication that has never seemed to help. It has been awhile since I have taken any meds. Since i have stopped with the meds I have been able to hold the thoughts at bay for the last five years or so. All the meds did was cloud my entire head. I couldn't think straight and the stuff I should know would take me forever to recall.  The suicidal thought were still around even on the  meds. I have so much anger and hatred built up. I have no idea were it all comes from. I feel lost and alone. I have no pride or dignity. I don't know what to do. I always think of what my actions would be like on my mom and that helped, but now I just don't care. If i had to pick a way it would be carbon monoxide poisoning. This is how far my thoughts have been getting as of late. The first time was with a gun. My moms boyfriend at the time caught me before I fired and put a stop to it. the second time was with pills. I just don't know what to do. I am not sure if I am crying for help or if I want to finish what I started years ago. Please someone, could you help me figure out what is wrong with me? I'm tired from the battle. I just want to get these thought to stop. Sorry if this is too jumbled to understand. Please I need help.

We were hoping to call when he leaves for work today-he’s leaving in about 15 minutes. I’m really scared and I think he’ll continue to come after us even after he goes to jail so we’re probably going to have to get a restraining order. Considering we’re a financially unstable family this is going to majorly impact the way we live. We live in a two bedroom apartment so we’re probably going to have to move to a studio or anything else that’s cheaper.

(he’s never expressed this. he’s actually expressed the complete opposite which is nice) but i feel like i’m being too clingy and too annoying leading me to want to spend some alone time in my apartment but my apartment just makes me more sad because i’m alone and i feel useless like no one care???,1.0
"Taking too much spaceTo preface this, both my older and younger sister have mental health issues that strained my family to the point where I was told to suck up my feelings because my mom couldn't handle it all.

If I die, they don't have to worry about my college, my hospital bills, my food bills, anything. They can focus on my sisters. They won't have to worry about fixing me.

I'm tired of learning, keeping an appearance and ""listening"" to others. Every time a new problem arises all i think to myself is ""I wanna kill myself"", and not that saying in a sarcastic tone but in a real tone where I'm actually so tired of doing everything. I've been going to the gym for the past 3 months and wourkouts feel great but the moment I step out of the shower and get a clear head i start feeling down because I'm left alone with my real thoughts. Video games started to bore me, I see no carrer/school path i want to pursue,  human relationships became to tiring to maintain or even create. I've noticed I started smiling impulsively just to fit the social norms. Even around people I'm comfortable with I started to just smile to let them know I'm hearing them out but i have a sudden realisation in my head that I seriously don't give a shit. I've also have a really high standard I set for myself in everything I do and once one bad thing happens I just give up and feel sad for not accomplishing anything. This semester i passed 5 out of my 6 classes but I still feel like shit because I have to retake one class. In my mind if it's not perfect its not good at all. My video game skill deteriorated to the point that i'm average at most games and i feel like shit because I dont have fun anymore becase i know i'm not one of the better players. I have a lot of self doubt and idk how to fix it. I tried ""PMA"" and letting the little things go but that lasts for a day and i go to my old self.

"Suicide-freeThank you everyone here for not shaming against those who are suicidal. The connection &amp; knowing someone truly understood and felt what I was going through means the world to me. I just wanted to take a moment to say thank you to the people of this sub for helping me get past my suicidal thoughts. 

After having no direction for my life, drug problems and being made homeless I've managed to get a job, I'm no longer homeless and I'm going to university to study to become a paramedic, which work will give me time off for. 8 months sober.

The only downside is that I still don't see my 2 year old daughter because her mother won't let me; but you know, I dont blame her because of the person I used to be. Maybe in a few years or when she's older she will come to understand. Or perhaps not, who knows. 

You can turn it all around guys. The thing that sparked it for me when I was talking to someone from this sub they said ""if you're gonna do it, try living your life doing things you wouldnt have dreamed of doing or are too scared to do, help people... fuck a prostitute... Its never too late to change""

And that's what truly resonates with me. It's never too late to change. 

If any of you are in England and wanna inbox me, I can give you my number or we can just have a chat. If you're homeless like I was I can help the best I can; I just want you to know I'm here for you guys like you were for me.

I suffer from High functioning depression and always try to push myself to do my best and get sad over my own shortcomings.

"I don't know how to do this any longer. I have so many worries and lost so much.I've struggled with depression my whole adult life, I have always been a little anxious and lacking energy but I always had one thing going for me, my wife, a beautiful doctor who I lucked out on, meeting her in high school before my illness really took hold. Back when I was a straight A student and had prospects. 

It has been 13 months since she left me. 13 months since I entered this hell. She wasn't attracted to me anymore. I spent most of the first year constantly reaching out to her for comfort, the dumbest thing you can do, I know. And I didn't get much comfort anyway, just found out how happy she seemed and how fast she moved on. I nearly took my own life in February but an uncle died suddenly and I couldn't put my mom through two close family deaths at once.

I can't connect with anyone properly. Not like her. I'm still head over heels in love with her. She was my best friend, we traveled the world together more than once. She told me I never had to worry because I'd always have her. 

I've tried to imagine being with someone else for over a \*year\* but I just can't. I've had opportunities to go on a couple of dates but they make me feel sick, honestly. I don't love anyone else. I'm not interested in anyone else, not at all. The idea of kissing someone else is just horrible. 

I cut off all contact with her 3 months ago. I figured I'd just work on myself like I'd never worked before, learn to stand on my own in life and maybe in a few months I'd talk to her again and she'd be surprised by the changes I'd made. The first two months I didn't get too far. Work was tiring and getting the energy and confidence to get out there and go to the gym or make friends was too much but I felt relief in not having to face up to reality and avoiding her. I saw my doctor and asked for some pills to help get me out there improving myself and he gave me some. I've been working out, bought new clothes, working well at work and even booked a short holiday just to try to find some short term happiness. But this past week I've just dreamed about her more intensely than ever. This nightmare that I'll call her in 6 months like a new man but she'll have moved on won't leave me.",2.0

"meh...I don’t know if it’s helping or hurting knowing some people are just a miserable as me. I’m at a point where I’ve just lost hope of ever being happy with myself. There’s no point. I told myself if I lost weight I’d be happier but I’m not. I pushed the reason for my depression onto aspects of my life but even after changing them I still feel just as bad if not worse. 
I can’t look at someone without thinking how they are better than me. I’m not good at anything, I’m not smart, I don’t have a good personality, and I’m definitely not gonna get carried by my looks.

It doesn’t really bother me anymore, if I was them I’d leave too. 
I’m so confused on what I want to do. I don’t see a future for myself and I can barely do anything without having a mental breakdown. I’m making everyone around me miserable too. I just want it to stop, I just wanna be okay. 
I miss being a kid and not having to worry about anything. I just wanna go outside and play for hours and make up stories with friends and just be happy. But no matter what I do I’m not. I just wanna feel something other than whatever I’m feeling now.

"Ah, the feeling of love.I started feeling love for the first time in my life around 2-3 weeks ago. I have feelings for a girl who I met when I came to my new school, whom I became really close friends with, then we somehow got separated, without any particular event and that was the moment I realized I had a huge fucking crush on her. She is so cute, so beautiful, and smart that I can't even explain. She is like the first ray of sunlight I saw in years.

But here's the thing, she doesn't even want to talk to me and she sometimes tells lies to avoid talking to me. She leaves me on seen, 10 minutes later calling leaving on seen ""rude"", talking to others for hours and hours but then when I ask if she wants to chat she says ""my communicaton.exe stopped"", but simultaneously talking to someone else.

I love her. More than I have loved anything in life. But she doesn't, thus hates me.

All my life I've just wanted to be a good person and do good things on this sad and doomed little planet, but when I look at myself in the mirror all I see is a disappointment.

I thought I fell in love with this trans guy. And maybe I just don’t know how to be open. I’m trying to. I realize or more so guess she thinks I’m something else. I want to love her but idk if It’s meant to be. She made me feel things I’ve never felt before. And that was taken realizing my incapable wall like nature. I feel like it’s too hard for me to understand her. But we are taking a break for a week. I’m going to call her on Friday and see how that goes. Trying to love myself, trying to forgive myself so I can love and forgive others. Realizing my narcissistic tendencies. I will have to deal with the guilt of bad decision. I can not control. I pray to stay above this creeping depression, because 30 min earlier I was contemplating making my body parts go up inside an 18 wheeler. Kinda worries me how bad the extremes are. I think somethings wrong. Any one understand this? Is there anyway to stay above the creeping death ",2.0

"Just some thoughts on how I feel.I can hardly believe that I am posting here. Not even sure what to say. I just know that I need to talk, somehow, without filters. Without needing to be looking to ""fix"" myself. 

I am 48 and have been a happy person most of my life. I had a fairly abusive upbringing and was subject to fairly severe bullying in school. I have risen above that (with a lot of work and counselling) and am in a 17 year marriage with two wonderful step kids in their 20s. I have a job that I am good at and that I mostly enjoy.

The problem is that I am sad. In no small part because my relationship with my wife is going south and I don't know how to fix it. Everything I try seems to make it worse.  Her Mother passed a couple of months ago and that was just the most recent icing on the difficulty cake.  

The amount of swirling that is going on in my head and the lack of energy just makes most things so much work. I still go through the day, doing what I should, but it feels like an act.  If I show my sadness it makes my wife scared and aggressive so I fake it as best I can.

At the moment I just want the pain and sadness to end. It's not that I want to kill myself, just that I don't want to deal with things any more. I am seeing a counsellor, which certainly helps, but, for whatever reason, it is not enough.  I don't feel like it is fair to burden anybody I know. This is a huge burden for anyone when a friend tells them that they need help and is considering suicide. It doesn't help much that, due to so many factors, including a profound lack of motivation and energy, I have not been very good at staying in touch with people.

I don't know if I am depressed or not and have considered going to the doctor. Unfortunately my last two family doctors both quit to move out of the country (Canada) and finding a new Doctor seems like a huge mountain to climb. Going to a walk-in clinic doesn't seem like an option as they are all ""get-in, get a prescription, get out.

I know, intellectually, that people would be unhappy if I did do something like this but it just doesn't seem to matter. I don't have an immediate plan or anything but I don't want to feel the way I feel.

Not sure what I expect from this but I figured saying something, even to a group of anonymous people on reddit, is better than staying locked in the silence. ",2.0

"Another post written at 3 am about wanting to die.My father was a man that realized he had a fear of heights mid way jumping into fatherhood. He realized that a life void of drugs, was too much for him to bear. When addiction clawed it’s way from inside of him, nobody was left to clean up the pieces. I was only a baby when addiction, leaked it’s broken faucet muddy tap water into my footie pajamas. Addiction was the bedrock that set the foundation of my parents marriage. Addiction was the third partner in parent’s bedroom. Regret and a whole lotta pain only peaked their head through the cracks on the bedrock when their wasn’t enough cement “I hate yous” eroded inside. Jail was my parent’s favorite anniversary spot when they got caught stealing to feed their addiction again. I learned to love through expensive gifts so that way I could always buy my happiness. I learned to judge how much a man loved me from how much money he was willing to spend. I learned to love from a woman who didn’t know the difference between bitterness and affliction, couldn’t find the anger she tried so desperately to escape. I spent half of my life searching for myself in the bottom of boys with pretty smiles, and hard hands. Ive spent all of my life questioning why it was easier for my parents to love drugs than me. Questioning why it’s easier for me to love boys who don’t love me back. Because of this fact I didn’t question when I was raped. I like to pretend that loving myself is easy, but it’s soo damn hard. Especially when I’ve been conditioned to believe that I am worth nothing more than the punchline. Nothing more than a woman or a black bitch but if I’m really lucky I get to a female. That is until I’m to loud to be feminine, too obnoxious to stand in my womanhood, too eww to be considered anything more than not enough. When I was 14 I walked in on my grandmother snorting cocaine, perhaps this is the reason why I couldn’t bring myself to say grandmother until my great grandmother took her last breath. After I was raped, I didn’t feel like caring anymore. So I purposely endangered my life. Sometimes I wish I was murdered, instead of raped. It’d be easier that way, life after death should be easier that way.  I’ve spent my whole life on a calligraphy crash course called self destruction, and I can’t stop now. I’m ready to die, but the strength I need continues to allude me, confuse me. ",2.0

"Some of us are not built to survive.That's lately what I've been thinking. 

My life is just an endless myriad of suffering. Consistently used and tossed away. I miss the pills. At least on the pills I didn't feel like throwing myself out of a moving car.

I fantasize about it almost every day. How I want to die somewhere beautiful and cold. Somewhere in the snow. 

I survived a cult. I endured a childhood full of rejection, rape, abuse, beatings and death - Only to have it continue into my teenage years. My own family disowned me because of their religion, I was denied education, medical treatment and a place to call home. I fell in love and thought I could be cured. She married me (foolishly) and I can't seem to overcome my disorders. I've been fully diagnosed with a plethora of them. I was too broken for most of our relationship to treat her as well as I should have.

I'm proficient with music, I hold a job, I'm good at most things I put my hand to but I can't be happy. The nightmares, the anxiety, the depression, the lack of friends, lack of family, lack of support... it eats away at me every day. Everything is overwhelming, it hurts and I'm afraid. I don't want to check into a hospital where they'll forcefeed me pills and I'll be away from my wife. She's the only thing that keeps me grounded. I tried to start a family with her and failed.

I want to stop being sick. I used to be afraid. But now I just feel apathetic. I feel resigned. I've been thinking about the gentlest and best way to end it but haven't come to a solid decision. I was thinking of something to just quietly put me to sleep. I'm tired of trying. I've tried for years to be better and not be my situation. I've been to therapists, doctors, been on pills, tried almost everything I can think of to improve but nothing is working. The darkness is winning.",2.0

My career almost encourages substance abuse and to anyone looking in it would be a dream job.

"I don't remember a time when I didn't wish to be deadI am 16. I have an undiagnosed chronic intestinal issue (visible damage when I was scoped, unknown cause). I have a tendency towards very bad anxiety and I can't stand being in public when I feel like I'm going to throw up. Because of this, I miss a lot of school. When you miss a lot of school, you're required to get a doctor's note excusing you for every day that you're gone. My family has no money, and the many hospital visits made my relationship with my parents completely despondent. Also, my main doctor decided that my anxiety was the cause of my propensity for ulcers (something that studies do not support) and prescribed me Prozac. I told him that I was opposed to taking something that would alter the way that I think/feel. He decided that he didn't like that, so he described me as a belligerent, faking patient and now, no doctor in my county will see me. 

So now, I can't get a doctor's excuse, so I'm listed as unexcused, so I can't make up missed work, so I'm doing badly in classes, so my parents see me as their failure and don't wish to talk to me. My friends guilt me for being gone so often and started distancing themselves.


On an entirely separate note, my girlfriend of two years told me a few months ago that she hasn't felt that she loved me for the last year or so of saying it.

So here I am, holding onto the one thing that used to make me happy and waiting for the inevitable moment when she scrapes me off and I'm entirely alone. The only reasons that I haven't ended my life are my two brothers. One of them is 20 and the other is 5. I know that, in both of their cases, I don't want to imagine the pain that it would cause for them.

I used to self mutilate, but it didn't work and was too risky. Anymore, I just feel like I'm treading water in the middle of the ocean and I'm so tired that I'm just waiting for it to take me in.",2.0

I've already taken a lot of codeine and valium and am sitting here with a slip knot around my neck drinking vodka. Could anyone talk to me until I pass out please? I'm too much of a coward to straight hang myself but I can't take the risk that my overdose is not enough. Survival is no longer an option.


I'm scared to go out alone but I can't call anyone, please just chat with me?

Update- I was found and taken to ER, I've just been admitted to a psych ward, who know what will happen. Also I'm 26 not 16, have been suffering for 16 years lol",2.0

not gonna be here for much longer. i give it a few monthsI'm always laying in bed alone.. That's all I do (no exaggeration) because I have no one. Everyone around me wants me to live the way that THEY want me to live. I am tired of doing everything I can to make others happy because i'm unable to make myself happy. My brother has all of these friends around him and I have absolutely no one. All I have is my dog. Living is not fucking working out for me. I've held on for too long. Nothing has gotten better.  I have tried to fix my life but there is no fixing. I am not meant to be here. I do not belong. I've tried to make friends but everyone either shuts me out or makes a mockery out of me. Everything is always going to be terrible for me.; all of the people around me? they have great lives.. but I don't... you want to know why? it's because i'm not meant to be here. I am simply meant to be miserable and that's how it's always going to be until I find the guts to kill myself. There is no sense in me trying to live and I feel pathetic for doing so. ,2.0

 But now, even though I don’t desperately need to die I still think about Suicide. I’m worthless i hate the person that I am and their is a constant voice in my head repeating all of my insecurities and mistakes. I’m constantly stressed out and in pain, But, when every I think about suicide all those feelings go away. I don’t care that I’m not the smartest or the most handsome or that I have messed up my life. Because it doesn’t matter anymore when your dead. I’m posting again because I’m against a wall and I feel like it’s only a matter of months before I go though with it.

"I would like to be helped(I apologise for clunky grammar and various mistakes in advance)


But can I be helped? This subreddit is dedicated to helping suicidal people. And by ""helping"" you mean ""preventing people from killing themselves"". Now I would really like to be helped, I do want to continue go on living, but I don't see a realistic outcome when I'm still alive and not in pain.


So what kind of help can be of use?


1) I might share my story (oh, what a wall of text that's going to be), but will sharing help me? I don't see how. I shared my story before with others. It never helped.


2) I might receive some advice, but you see I fancy myself a rather smart man. Can this advice contain some truth I haven't already thought of (or heard from shrinks or other people)? I want this truth to be there, but I sincerely doubt it.


3) As unlikely as it might be, I might find here some kind and caring person for me to weep on their shoulder. But will that be anything but a temporary reprieve? Again I honestly don't see how.


I am genuinly trying to find some other way how I can be helped by this subreddit, but I fail. Suicide is not a passionate impulse for me, but a premeditated mecry kill. And given that I might as well have only a couple of days to live (unless I chicken out) I suppose that in my case there is nothing in the power of this subreddit to do to help me. In some other cases you were really able to help some people, but for someone like me it looks like it's impossible. And that's really sad (if you ask me). Well, just an interesting observation I guess.


I've been suicidal for many years now, but have always able to fixate myself on some goal to work towards. But recently all goals lost all meaning, the pain intensified. I would've gotten through that, but at the same time I saw with the utmost clarity that the reason for my failings in life were my personal flaws. I've been trying many years to fix them and to no avail. (yes, without context you can't really make sense of what's written above, I undersand) Theoretically after additional many years of efforts I might (only might mind you) be able to finally ""become a normal boy"", but for the love of God I can't find a reason why I shouldn't just end it here and now and spare myself the suffering.

"If there's no cure for PTSD, I don't want to live anymore.I've had PTSD for basically my entire life due to severe abuse as a child. I've had times where my symptoms haven't been as bad, and I take a medication that has helped so much by stopping the nightmares. But I've never been free of the symptoms. I've tried everything. I've tried therapy, medication, SSRIs, anti-anxiety medication, yoga, and I've gone back to therapy multiple times. But I'm still broken.

I still get panic attacks. I still get flashbacks. And I am worthless and I hate myself. I've never not felt worthless, I've never not hated myself. And when people talk about sex or things related to it, I feel scared and sad and sometimes get panicky. Like I know on a logical level that's a normal thing people think is safe or even happy, but to me it's the worst thing that exists and it's terrifying. Sometimes it triggers flashbacks, or panic attacks. And I'm still afraid of men. And whenever I see fathers with daughters, my immediate thought is, she's in danger. And I know I'm broken. So I understand why I don't have anyone who cares about me, because I don't even care about me. I'm worthless and damaged and everything I say and do is wrong. I have no one in my life. I don't have one single person. I don't have family(bc they're abusive &amp; out of my life). I don't have friends. Every friend I've ever had, I ruined the friendship. I'm always the one asking for help and support, never the one being helpful and supportive. I'm like a poisonous horrible leech. I take and give nothing back except for disasters and storms and tears. And who wants someone like that in their life? I don't blame anyone for giving up on me or throwing me away. I'm bad for people, and everyone who has ever cared about me would have been better off if they had never met me. I don't want to be around me either.

I don't want to die, but I don't want to live like this. And I've never been free of it, I've never seen the world or myself the way healthy people see the world and see themselves. I cannot continue to live if I know that I will never be 100% cured of PTSD and be able to live like a normal healthy human. I can't do this anymore. I can't.",2.0

I was really suicidal for most of my teens, starting around 13-14 when I lived with my Mom post-divorce and she abused my siblings and myself. She overdosed and went into a coma for a week or so, and I still find myself thinking back to those days but at least they ended because of it. I tried therapy a couple times, but never clicked with a therapist and gave up. I graduated, went to college, and things got better; still suicidal, still have the depressive spells and the cyclic mood, but much more manageable. To the point where I could enjoy life sometimes. 

Being back home, I bend over backwards to not be rude, have to be overly submissive and polite, and get absolutely 0 recognition or thanks for it. Not even a ""thanks"" or ""you're welcome."" Any bit of rudeness causes a flip out. And I feel myself slipping back into old depressive habits.

So, last year was the worst year of my life. At this point it doesn’t matter why anymore. In 2019 I tried to kill myself like five times and the last one a friend took me to a psychiatric hospital but they didn’t admitted me cause the rules stated that at least 2 people who didn’t take meds and were also female stand by my side 24/7 and I don’t have those people (fucking rules, what’s the point of asking for help then). My parents took me with them to their house for a few weeks but never talked about what happened. I can’t afford a private hospital and my insurance doesn’t cover it. Talking about insurance, the only reason I’m not killing myself right now is because I have to be alive at least for another 8 months so my parents can cash out my life insurance.

(Was just thinking about taking care of my drug problem but what’s the point anyways) I was too afraid of walking out of my flat cause my ex lives EXTREMELY close and the thought of just seeing him makes me wanna die even worse. I can’t even took the subway without having a panic attack.
But I was trying to get better, I really was. I go to therapy every week and I’m taking my meds, I tried to get to know new people and I actually went out a few times. 
Today I was feeling with a lot of energy, I was “fine” for the first time in 9 months and decided to walk to the store. And I saw him, I saw my ex. And everything went down once again and worse than ever.
I won’t kill myself tonight because I feel really guilty about all the time and money my parents spend on me and I feel like I owe them at least the insurance, I mean it’s more cash than I will ever gonna be able to earn. But I can’t keep going, I swear I tried my best and did everything in my hands to get better. 
The world is an awful place and it keeps getting worse everyday, all the people are rude and selfish. I’m worthless, I don’t contribute with anything in any way.
I’ve been clinically depressed for 13 years now, 5 years ago I was diagnosed with borderline and well, the anxiety it’s always there. I’m also on process of a chronic genetic illness diagnosis.

"am i upside down or is everything else fucked up?So I have been recommended by a psychiatrist to get on fluoxetine and buproprion. My reaction earlier today: ""You're joking, right?"" This surprising sequence of events probably started when I started feeling unmotivated in med school and my girlfriend dumped me. (Although I can't be sure of that. Thinking in depth about my childhood I may have had depressive symptoms since well, as long I can remember). The tipping point was when I caught myself seriously considering jumping from the George Washington Bridge as I walked across. That scared me. I have pretty intense suicidal thoughts a couple times a week (noticing ways to kill myself with things in the environment and weighing lethality). However drugs seem like a bad idea. They're not going to change the facts that everyone hates me, that I'm ugly, that I'm a failure at everything I try, that I'm boring, etc.",2.0

"Don't know how much longer I can hold it at bayI've been craving non-existence for over a year now. It's excruciating, the desire to end it. But I bottle it up and bury it deep, because although I'm a worthless excuse of a person, I still feel the need to no put my family and (very few) friends through what comes after a person commits suicide. 

Ever since I was young I always thought that suicide was a selfish thing to do. It's something a lot of people think, at least to my knowledge. I'm in college now, and my mother has been guilt-tripping me about how much it costs her me being here. Little does she know she's only contributing arguments to the side of me that wants the jump off a fucking building. The more my life goes down the toilet the more I see suicide as a relief, not only to me, but to every other life I manage to ruin by proxy.

After all, all I've done so far of any significance is weigh people that I love down. Wouldn't it be a kindness to get this obstacle out of their way? Is it really *that* selfish? And if it is, so what? I'm supposed to keep suffering so people don't have to cry about it for some time?

If it wasn't for this one thing that keeps me happy I would have no reason to live. I find myself just... Laying on my couch thinking.. What is the point really. I can't bring myself to do anything, I haven't been able to eat so now I have dropped under 100 pounds... There is just.. Nothing I want to do. A good chunk of my thoughts are just constantly thinking that I just straight up don't want to be alive... I feel like I am dying slowly on the inside and that my actual death would just... Lift all of that from me. Ever since I was a teenager I have had this ghost haunting me. There is much more than this feeling that makes me want to end it all...

"I think I need to stop prolonging the inevitable.Hey people. It's 2AM here and my brain is fogged as fuck, so I'll give a basic overview of how shitty things are and sorry if this is a mess.

I'm a 24 year old male from the United Kingdom. I've always been a socially inept loser who can only blend into social groups by playing a court jester style character. I'm unemployed, live with my Mum, have no skills, low intelligence, no friends, no real interests and just generally feel like I don't have any kind of belonging in this world, nor do I identify with any aspect of it. This world is a fucking horrible place, built with suffering and oppression of the weak into its inherent nature. I don't really want to spend another 50 years carving out an existence on this planet when it's pretty obvious I am a complete genetic dead end and am not equipped to handle life. 

I've had nothing but bad luck from the beginning, to top it all off, this year I've developed a condition called Peyronie's which has bent and shrunken my previously decent sized dick and I am being kept up every night from the pain. I honestly hope I can just develop cancer, I'm sick of this shit, I just want to die but am too weak to do it myself. I've tried everything, SSRIs, therapy, self help, none of it has helped.

"Not sure what to do anymoreHi, I’ve never posted on here before. Everything seem so messed up in my life right now. I keep having nightmares every night about horrible things that have happened to me in the past, and horrible things that I’ve done in the past. It’s like I just can’t shake these thoughts. The dreams compounded with the constant depression and anxiety are making it so difficult for me to go on day by day. I love my husband and I don’t want to leave him, I know this will hurt him so much. But I’m just not sure what to do anymore, I’m really at my wits end, I am crying just writing this because I don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve been getting therapy and they put me on some medicine for the nightmares. I journal and try to talk things out with family and friends, But nothing seems to be helping. I feel like the only way out right now is to take my own life. The only way to end all of this pain and sadness. I don’t even know what to do anymore, I just don’t. I just know I don’t think I wanna be here anymore. I feel so horrible about the things I’ve done in the past, and all of the people I have hurt. I randomly find myself saying I’m sorry out loud all the time. I’m trying to see if I can find some time to go see my therapist again.

"My world is crumbling apart around me and nobody caresAll of my hopes and dreams have been shattered, all of my hobbies have been ruined, all of my friends have abandoned me, and my family has stopped caring for me or giving a toss about anything I say.

I have nothing left.

I have officially reached rock bottom.

I'm sick and tired of putting so much effort into creating my own content, and nobody noticing it, meanwhile, some guy just waltzes in with something less effort put into making or sharing it, yet it always does better than anything I make without even trying!

I'm sick of games now being just about making money, be it the DLC and Loot Crates of modern AAA games, or the filthy scalpers and resellers of the retro gaming scene, or the countless shovelware and ""8-bit nostalgia"" games in the indie market.

I'm sick of Hollywood always producing the same cookie cutter films everywhere. I'm sick of hearing the stupid pop music on the radio stations everyone I know listens to, all of which sounds the same!

I'm sick of trying to promote my native language and trying to keep it alive, only to be told that it's just some dialect (despite UNESCO recognising it as a language) and can never get anybody interested in learning it despite my best efforts.

I'm sick of people obsessing over social media, memes and shit like Spotify, Netflix or Steam. I feel like the only person left who still enjoys collecting everything physically, but it's dying off because there aren't enough people who are doing that.

I'm sick of being told ""Get over it!"", ""Don't talk to me, I'm not a professional"" or ""Go to a doctor"" whenever I complain or get upset over something.

I'm sick of my ASD making me incompetent in everything I do. I can barely perform basic goddamn tasks! I get ridiculed for anything I do and I can't hold my own in an argument or debate to save my life.

Nobody cares about me. People are selfish, they only pretend to be nice and helpful if they think they can benefit themselves, but once they realise that they can't, they don't think twice about abandoning you!

""Oh, it'll get better"", oh yeah? I've been waiting over 10 years for things to get better and they've only gotten worse!

"2020 - The year we lost everything... and more.Its interesting when I read on social media how people complain that 2020 sucks because they haven't been able to go watch their favorite movie, swim by the sea or go to their favorite restaurants.

I am from South Africa and COVID-19 plus a run of bad luck ruined my life. I lost my job 6 months ago. Company shut down due to COVID-19. In the same month, found out that my wife is pregnant - we've been married for 2 years. And in the same month, both my parents contracted COVID-19.

Fast forward to today - wife is heavily pregnant, both parents passed away and still no job. Just some odd jobs here and there. There are nights I pretend not to be hungry just so that my wife and my young brother can eat.

I never thought that someone as outwardly strong as I am could wake up earlier that my wife each morning to cry. I have to hide tears from my wife and hope each day I find some small job to do that can help us to eat.

Saturday I got a one-day job offloading trucks for 14 hours. Got paid R500 (about $29). We ate well but this week its back to square one.

To top it all off, I damaged my spine with the heavy lifting &amp; currently I am not able to get out of bed. Our neighbor took me to the doctor and he says I have a slipped spinal disc which will need some sort of surgery in order to re-align. To top it all off, the landlord is tired of the delays in rent payment and has asked us to move out at the end of this month.

I am trying to convince my wife to give the baby away once it is born. I know this might affect our marriage in the long run, but I can't let my child live like this. Savings all gone and now I think I might be physically incapable of taking care of my family. My wife has been asking for help from relatives too but I'm sure they are tired of us now.

Sleep. Eat. Exercise. Go outside. Socialize. Study. Read. Draw. Write. Cant. Do. Anything. Fuck off everything. I just stay in bed all day sometimes crying. I can't even go to the grocery store without an hour long panic attack. It takes so much energy to lift my head off my pillow. I'm surprised I'm even able to take a shower every day. But that's about as far as my executive function goes.

Am I going to be like this in my adult hood too?? I was only happy when I was 12 but that was a very good year..3 years ago.. I'll never be that happy again. All my friends from then left me behind but tbh they were actually pretty crappy friends most of them I start to realize but like where do I fucking start god I don't want to die I don't want to, I'm scared, scared of everything, what other choice??

"I changed my mind, well for now...Since I can't stand being here in this house anymore, I'm deciding to move to my grandma and aunts house on Saturday. They told me that if I was ever feeling sad or I felt lonely at my house, then I could move in with them. They even said that they would love it if I moved in with them.  However I still don't know if I'm gonna go over there on Saturday. The last time I slept over at their house was almost 5 years ago. 5 years ago I used to go there on Saturday mornings and come back to my house on Sunday night. I only did this for about 9 months and then never slept over at their house again. I did visit them several times a month on Saturdays. When my mom got sick of cancer in October 2009, I had moved over there since I had no one to take care of me here at my house. I moved back to my house in June 2011. So I haven't lived there since I was 8 years old. I'm worried that I'm gonna get home sick or something. If I do move over there I don't know what the fuck I'm gonna do when I start school in August. I don't wanna go to school over there. The schools over there are awful. I used to go to school over there when I lived there. If I change my mind and kill myself instead, I don't know what my grandma and aunt are gonna think. They care about me so much. I don't know what the fuck I'm doing with my life anymore and feel like I'm losing my mind here. If I go over there I feel like I'm still gonna be depressed but not as bad. I sometimes find myself crying at random points during the day. I don't know how I'm gonna hide my depression if I do go over there.

"My Short GoodbyeI’m sorry mama. I’m sorry i couldn’t be the daughter you deserved. Thank you for always doing everything you could for me. i’m sorry i never told you that i love you. I do. I’m sorry i never hugged you back. I’m sorry for always being annoyed. I’m sorry i could never talk to you about gossip or whatever moms and daughters talk about. i’m sorry i wasn’t the daughter you deserved. 

I’m sorry brother. I know we never talk about deep personal things but i do love you. gosh it’s weird typing that lol. You were cool sometimes. Except for the times you would snitch on me. Not cool dude. Thanks for giving me thick skin though. Take care of Freddy for me. 

I’m sorry Freddy. You were the best cat in the world. Thank you for always making me feel like i had a purpose. That purpose was to be your mom. I hated when you would open my bedroom door to get in but wouldn’t close it so i’d have to get up from my sleep to close it, almost tripping from being half asleep. I’ll miss doing that. Thank you for keeping me company. Thank you for letting me kiss your forehead and returning the kiss to my nose. I love you so much. I’m so sorry. 

I’m sorry to the boy i loved. You were the last thing keeping me here. You weren’t in love with me. I have no reason to stay anymore. 

Dad, you’re the reason i’m doing this. I couldn’t be your perfect little daughter with good grades. That’s all you wanted me to have. Is good grades. You’re the reason i don’t have friends. I can’t have any apps because of my stupid grades. I can’t take drivers ed because you don’t want me to leave the nest. You don’t even feel like a dad anymore. All i’m alive for im your eyes is good grades. You took everything from me. Fuck you. 

I’m numb. I was going to do this last night but i don’t know how i should. i don’t want to fail at it. I was only 17. I had many more years to see. I would say it was a fun ride but it wasn’t.

And my boyfriend? We both have issues with depression but I'm medicated for it. He's so supportive but I'm terrified to tell him I'm contemplating this. 

And my doctor. I lve been considering going to her and asking for something prn like Xanax or Ativan but idk what to do, or if I tell her about my call to the suicide hotline? Will that go in my record? I'm just... I don't know what to do anymore. Please someone help me

Edit: hey everyone, just wanted to let everyone know I'm okay. I told my family and my boyfriend. They were super understanding, and I just went to the doctor.

"The Mind and Body Connection is RealI was suicidal because who I believed to be the love of my life and soulmate ended things with me. He knows I’ve been depressed and suicidal, yet he continues to ignore my calls and texts. As a result, I’ve been more anxious than I’ve ever been. I haven’t been taking care of myself. I’ve been eating terribly, not hydrating, and barely sleeping even though I stay in bed for hours at a time. So I haven’t been feeling well—-headaches, nausea, stomach pain, and so on. Again, he knows this. I’ve told him, but he’s been avoiding me instead. Well, today I landed up in the ER. I was vomiting all day. The pain in my head and lower back became unbearable. So, I went to the ER for that (not suicidal ideation) and found out I had a kidney infection. I’m in relatively good health and don’t have health issues, so for me, this was the last straw. I wanted to end my life because of this person. But because the stress from him not understanding me and avoiding me has led me to become physically ill, I am done chasing after him. He is not the love of my life and he is not my soulmate. Whoever that person is (if they even exist) would understand my depression, anxiety, and thoughts of suicide. He wouldn’t isolate me and leave me alone, confused, and sad. So if anyone out there is feeling like they want to end their life because another person didn’t “value” you, then that shouldn’t be the reason. I’ve learned the hard way that this person isn’t worth your time and energy. Because there is a deep connection between the mind and the body, so any psychologically stress will lead to chronic health issues as well. He wasn’t worth the stress. I’m better off alone and I’m realizing that’s okay and you should too. It might take a personal experience of some sort to realize it. I prayed to God yesterday wishing I was dead and then the next day I landed up in the ER. Life acts in mysterious ways. You never know what your struggle or your heartache or your loss will lead to. You may find your life purpose in that way. ❤️",2.0

I don't deserve to live, I need to die, I don't see a future for me. I know my parents love me unconditionally, but the fact that I'm even considering this PROVES that I should do it.

"Times like these I wish nobody in real life loved me so I could just off myself without remorse.I've been battling with these thoughts for years. It's never going to end. It's just never going to end. I was having a good day and then I went walk my dog and heard something from a fucking podcast that triggered me and now I'm crying in my room with all of this anger inside of me that I can't shake off. And it's never going to end, and I'm always going to go back to feeling this way. Why even keep trying, why even keep pretending.     

I wish I was completely alone in the world, except for those Internet friends that aren't really friends because you never meet with them and when you do they are never interested in seeing you again. They're fun, but they don't really care about you. I wish I only had them so I could once and for all take my minimal bucket list for life, do whatever I can to do those things, rob a bank, do violent things I've always wanted to do but never could because it would get me in so much trouble, pretend that I'm someone that I'm not for a little while and then go back home and kill myself.     

There. Dreams done, nothing else I want from life. No pressure on becoming a succesful adult. No pressure on being rich, no pressure on being smart with your time on this earth, no pressure on being sane. I was never sane, I always felt a connection with love and violence and for the most part I couldn't act on it the way I wished. So just satisfy that part of me and then going.      

But no. I have a mom and dad and sister who love me and a couple of real life friends who would be pretty sad too. I have to take responsability, keep studying some useless degrees in the hope I can make something useful out of them, look happy, look good phyiscally, try to earn good money, start a family sometime, and live until I'm 102 (because if you're going to be old, you better be really really old, the queen of old people).

When I was a kid, I thought everything would be okay if I got away from my parents. “Just get away from them, then before you know it, you’ll be yourself again.” used to help me hoard off suicidal thoughts and tendencies. 

But I’m 25 now. Haven’t lived with my parents in years. Hell, don’t even talk to them. Yet it’s the same. I’m still a depressed blob. Still holding onto trauma. 

Fuck near death experiences. They shouldn’t have saved me. They should have left me in the pool. Because now I know what death feels like. I felt death’s kiss for two and a half seconds. I think about those seconds almost every day of my life since then. 20 years later. 

No professional help I’ve received helped and I am done looking for strength inside myself. I’m fed up and I am done.

All I do is work and go to the ATM to take out money for therapy, doctors visits for medication, and more work. I barley sleep now and when I do I have nightmares, and I just am rushed around everywhere all the time.

I've thought about just getting a GED but I'm probably too stupid to manage it and my grandmother (whom I live with) already calls me a disappointment enough as it isz because of my failure to keep up with school.

My own mother also recently disowned me because my grandmother and I refused to gives her more money (she's literally always been unemployed so she mooches off of her mother and has even stolen money from my wallet before).

I have no one. And I feel like I'm stuck here, in this state of existing as basically a useless, (sort of) dropout, with no passions or real desires or talents.

That last mess is what's keeping me alive because I can't think about my mom or my brother or anyone going through that mess. People say suicide is selfish and thinking about suicide is selfish but really so many of us are just thinking about what will be better for those around us. Will it be better for me to stay here burdening you, or for you to have to clean up my mess but then not have to deal with me again? Either way, we all lose don't we?

I didn’t get through any trauma, I was simply not interested in doing anything from the beginning of my life. Never cared for my family, never had any sex drive or other “normal” feelings. I was told how extremely pessimistic I am since I remember. I decompose into the prime factors simply everything I do and wonder if I do it right or rather like a loser.

I am not suffering or anything, it just feels like a good option because I literally do nothing for this world, just exist and question everything.

"I'm terrified of my own self.I've lost the man I love because of my depression. And it was mostly because our relationship had become one sided.  He was becoming unhappy trying to support me. Because I live in an environment conducive to depression: graduate school in a town where I have no friends. I only had enough strength to keep my own demons at bay. I had nothing left to give him. I failed him. And I feel like I am only a burden to the people I love.  That all I will do is drag them down with me on my slowly,  but inevitably sinking ship. I'm so tired of fighting. And tonight my brain finally found the argument that could kill me. Because I lost my sister, a long time ago, I know what it is to lose someone you love. And the only thing that kept me from ever crossing the line of thinking about suicide to actually doing it was that I didn't want to put the people who love me through that. But I realized - yes, I still miss her and I always remember her, but that pain eventually fades. You find a way to continue.  So why wouldn't it be the same for them? It would hurt at first. But with time, I would only become a memory. I'm tired of hearing that my pain is overreacting or over dramatic. They aren't in my head.  They don't know how I feel.  They don't know how hard it is to fight against yourself. I go on through months or even years feeling miserable, just to feel a brief happiness. But that happiness always ends. So what's the point? This isn't living. This could barely even be considered surviving. And I'm just not strong enough anymore. I'm quickly running out of reasons to keep going. Because ""things will get better"" and ""just change your perspective"" and ""you're just overreacting"" just doesn't work anymore. Right now I see three choices before me: end it all, quit grad school and check in to a psychological hospital because I am honestly a danger to myself, or try to find a therapist willing to do pro bono because I can't afford therapy. Right now, the first option is most persuasive. I'm ready to give up.  ",2.0

I remember writing in a diary about my attempts (well, more like just 2 – ate every single pill I could find at home (even while my parents are doctors (so stronger medication can be found around the house), it did apsolutely nothing – didn’t even damage my liver or kidney or anything and the 2nd time was I was going to jump off a balcony, but when I was on the edge, my little sister (3 or 4 years at the time) came in and I couldn’t do it with her seeing).
After that I sort of gave up on it and just hid the diary on a top shelf. Later one some of the shelves were moved and when I looked, the diary wasn’t there, so I am sure as hell my parents found it, but thankfully avoided awkward conversations.

Anyways, now I’m 19, complete failure (which was to be expected, tbh) and still smile every time I think about dying. People have told me I have severe depression, however, for me it doesn’t seem to be so, it’s the same as it was 10 years ago – I just don’t see the point in living, it is not something that interests me. Not that I would hate it or anything, I’d just rather avoid it. Is that normal?

Within 2 weeks I am going back to spend my summer with my family and friends (haven't done that in 2 years) and I sort of have everything planned. I have bought 2 huge helium tanks for ''exit bag'' and also have some spare money to spend with my friends. Essentially I am thinking about just being as nice and loving as I can to my family (I do want them to know I love them) and spend some time together with my friends before doing it.

Am I making the right decision? I know you people will try to stop me, but is it really the right thing to do? If I have never had any willpower to live (and even when I was a bloody 9 year old kid, who's supposed to enjoy life), I have never seen it as something I want to do and  thinking about abandoning it makes me smile and happy every single time (sometimes drop a tear of happiness).

"Realized that I have a problem with suicide ideationRecently, I've realized that suicide has been creeping more and more on my mind. I used to simply think ""I just don't want to exist"" or ""I just want to sleep forever"", which is not good, but better than thinking ""I want to die"", but now it's getting increasingly worse. I probably won't do actually anything, I am too afraid to die and I also have reasons I don't want to die, but it's so scary that these are getting more and more common. It's starting to pop up almost every time I get in my car. The amount of times I've thought about simply driving into a tree at highspeed or driving into the river is absolutely terrifying to me. On top of that, I'm getting so overwhelmed by everything. I was just doing a school assignment and I got so overwhelmed for no reason, it's actually a pretty easy assignment. But I ended up getting so overwhelmed, I looked up to see which medicines we had could be used to overdose. I did end up stopping myself, but god, it scares me so much that this is getting worse and worse.",2.0

"How I know I'm fadingI know I am fading out at this point because bright shiny things in my life simply are not enough to fight back the darkness that ultimately will consume me.

That may sound a bit melodramatic but its true. I have a great job, I not only make good money but I make a difference in what I do every day. My daily actions help people reach a better quality of life. I sit as board member on two amazing non profit organizations helping women and children both domestically and internationally improve their lives. I have traveled the world a dozen times over and have countless memories but none of this seems to matter in the end.

It is getting hard again to get out of bed. The cancer treatments are keeping me alive but they will never cure me. I sit at home in the dark after my long days are done in silence broken only when it becomes to much and I cry. I will never again hold my son or the one true love of my life. I leave now for a few weeks for work and starting a school in Vietnam and yet I come home to silence and haunted memories.

Outside of work days go by and I never speak out loud. I crawled this week from my hotel bed to the toilet to vomit because I didn't bring enough pain medication due to my trip lasting long and it hurt so much I puked. I know I have done more good in this life than bad which is saying a lot because I am all to familiar with sin but I am genuinely afraid that I cannot carry on like this anymore.

I am simply not strong enough to carry all of this on myself and I cannot help but ask what will happen the day I cannot get out of that bed? It will be so many days or weeks before someone came looking and I know it would be horrible to end like that, and so I ask myself would taking myself out before it gets to that point be better? Would I at least then be able to keep a semblance of my dignity. Is laying in that state in my bed the way I want my life to be remembered? These thoughts keep cropping up and they terrify me more and more not because I hate them, and i do, but because I find myself hating them less every day now.

I am so afraid I will not have the strength to stand on my own soon and I feel like I am just fading now.",2.0

I guess my family will carry on staying in touch with their/my rapist when I die, using me to stay in denial by saying they ""tried to help"" (a huge lie, they wanted to idealise me as their 'helpless nutcase' - see the drama triangle), lying about me etc. while refusing to admit what they did along the way. But just... whatever now. It went too far. I was always a huge joke to everyone and they will clearly refuse to see things any differently. Even if they changed their minds, the message has already been marble-engraved into me. There's literally nothing that could be said. I am so angry that honestly, if I don't kill myself then I will probably just kill someone else.

My parents divorced when I was 5 years old and I had to live with my mother, we didn't really get along but she was the only person I had so we both made an efort and it worked for some time. But for the last 2 years we had many fights and things weren't the same, I didn't feel safe, loved, protected. Now I moved with my father in Belgium (I'm from Romania) thinking that it will be better. My dad already had a new family here, a girlfriend which had 2 children (they had been together for about a year and a half). I tought everything is good here, a stable family and it had been like this for a couple of months, but now my father started drinking very much every week, fights are always happening, but a couple of nights ago he took it too far. He told me go to buy him more alcohol at midnight, I said him that he should stop drinking and that is too cold outside to go now (everyone was sleeping and I didn't want to wake up them by going to search clothes, money, etc) and he started screaming at me. He dragged me outside in a t-shirt and shorts (there where like 5 degrees C and I had problems before because of going out in the cold without proper clothes, I suffered from sinusitis and would be fainting a couple of times a day. I had to stay in hospital for some time because of this). He managed to wake up everyone and they didn't take it too well that he forced me to buy alcohol in this situation. And after this argument he broke up with her (I really liked her, my brother and sister) but now he is jobless and we got to find a new place to live. I've had a couple of attempts before (I tried cutting, pills) and I think it would be easier to take it that way. Right now I can't go back to my mother and here I don't think I can do it with him drinking all the time.

I can give you a little backstory about what happened before that made me try it but it hurts real bad so I would rather avoid it if possible.

"9 months in hell just to end up worse off.9 months ago i received a job offer half way across the country. After talking over the opportunity with my friends, I decided to do it. Turns out, It was the biggest mistake of my life. For 9 months i was stuck in a house unable to leave for 8 hours a day. when i could leave, it was dark and the local businesses wouldn't allow a minor in, so there was basically nothing to do.

 I never made a friend while there, i never saved any money because my boss fucked me over, i didnt get to do a single fun activity in one of the most ""exciting"" cities in the US, I was stuck in a house with minimal human contact for 9 months. I even tried to kill myself on my birthday after I didnt get one call or text from anyone. I spent my birthday crying and alone. But I kept telling myself ""it'll all be worth it when you get home"" and ""all your friends are waiting for you, it'll be great when i get home."" And i even had a female friend i had been texting while away that i thought things might get more serious with. things were genuinely looking good when i got back.

 So my 9 months in hell ends. i come home so excited for change, and everything is worse. My friends are all gone or busy, Things with my lady friend turned into an utter disaster, My family sold my car while i was gone and now i have to get another job to buy a new one, my paranoia is worse than ever. Basically im worse off than when i left and now i have nobody to turn to while im super down. I dont know what to do now. i have so much shit in front of me i can't motivate myself to do anything. I'm going nowhere in life. my life is just a stagnant pool of disappointment and failure and i dont see any reason to keep trying. ",2.0

"I don't want to live forever aloneI have a bad habbit of accusing my friends and girls I get close with for having an alternative motive. I have extremly low self esteem from being a nerd all throughout school. I didn't actually become ""un-nerdy"" until mid high school. So due to being constantly ridiculed throughout most of my child-hood, I have real low self esteem.

Anyways, fast foward to a few years later, I started making lots and lots of money internet marketing and freelance web developing for a firm I owned. I went bankrupted late last year. I found out who my real friends are, a few of them left, and a good portion of them stayed. Although now whenever my friends (that I still have from my broke ages) don't answer my phone call, or forget to tell me about some plans, I IMMEDIATLY go off on them accusing me of not wanting around for my money. This happens a lot, but I did it two weeks in a row. Both times I apologized and did it again. I also lost my ex-girlfriend for also accusing her. 

I feel that deep down, because I'm so used throughout my whole childhood of having no friends, now that I finally got friends its ""too good to be true"" and I immediately think that everyone has an alternative motive for being friends with me. I accuse them, and then they don't want to be friends with me. I fucked it up, and I've accused people too many times, that now I'm afraid that because I was such a douche to them today, and wrongly accused them, they will not want to talk to me.

I feel that I've lost a good 85% of my friends. I can't stand being forever alone. I'd rather be dead. I wish there was some way I can fix my old friendships, and get a nice girl or better yet, get the old one back.",2.0

Since we're in quarantine my mental health is just slowly getting worse and tbh I don't care. My arm and stomach are fucking covered in cuts and burns and it's getting worse. One of my friends read a post I made a few days ago on another account in r/suicidewatch and text me telling me he was walking around to mine because it was like midnight and there was nothing stopping him from going out of the house and I freaked the fuck out and literally ran from him and my own house and was seriously considering killing myself that night. The thing is I don't want to worry any of my other friends by telling them what's going on but if I don't talk to someone I don't know what I'll end up doing. The thing is I do have people in my life i trust but I don't want to give them my issues to worry about aswell because they all have their own things going on and I don't need anyone else worrying about me.

"Im in a dying hour - please help (Life story)Hello people, I'm reaching out to anybody who can help me in any way they can. Please bare with my naivety as I don't usually reach out to people at all, let alone online.

&amp;#x200B;

I will try to summarise the hellishness of my life as short and simple as possible. Hopefully some of you can relate to some extent and help me.

I'm a 17 year old guy with depression, anxiety, and stress - all diagnosed as extremely severe.

My mental illness started as my father committed suicide 5 years ago, and has continuously gotten worse over the past 2 years.

I left school in 2017 to be a full time Graphic Designer which was great. I stayed at that job for a year up until 6 months ago when I attempted suicide, and abandoned my job that I was incredibly lucky to have at my age. My boss there treated me better than anyone else has in my life.

For the past 6 months I've been doing absolutely nothing with my life. Just waking up to find myself listening to sad music and annoyed that I have nothing to do, while simultaneously lacking any motivation to get a new job or meet new people.

Im currently on medication for anxiety and depression, but they aren't doing enough. I always find myself in a trance lost in my suicidal thoughts, I always just wonder what it would be like on the other side. Is it better? Is it worse? Is it nothing?  Is it everything? It's extremely luring as I'm naturally a very curious person with those kinds of ideas.

I take drugs like LSD and MDMA pretty often now. I take them with the hopes that one time I may just find or see where my dad went, or has been all these years, and just maybe to find some reason to live. From what I've heard, people have some profound experiences finding what they need in life while they're on those drugs.

Right now I currently have 3 MDMA Pills I plan to take when I finally have the guts to take my own life and plunge to my death off the shopping centre carpark - mainly hoping that the drugs give me the guts to jump that is.

Somebody please help me. I currently live in a state of fearing living more than dying, and I feel like time is running out.

"Always felt suicidal, but now i can't stop thinking about itHello...

I have always been a pretty unstable person, who put on a mask to look happy. Looking at my current situation, however, i can't help out but think i'm actually in my worst situation ever . I'm nearing my 30's , and the only reason i've been living until now... left me after 6 years of relationship, living together etc. .

I have been looking at the internet about how i should do it... It is full of ""it gets better"" posts from people who have never felt this in their lifes, and so-called ""experts"" who copy paste said posts from other sites. Right now, the only reason that i'm still alive is to give the middle finger to those people that told me to kill myself at some point (Mostly on social media on the internet).

Likewise my job is boring. I can cover the bills , but not enough to save properly. I **want to ask, how do people muster the courage to do it?** I'm in that state where I want... i need to do it, but I am super afraid... not of dying, just... of doing the act itself.

I would like to ask aswell if you think i should travel. Before going away, i always wanted to visit Germany, and Japan. I thought about spending all my money (So that there's no way back) in the trip, and once i finished enjoying it, to die peacefully.

PS: i'm not someone who is going to do it in minutes or hours. I simply feel my heart has given up after dealing with this for so long, and never been a person to do things without planning, so i want to plan it out right before i go. Still, please no ""itgetsbetter"" messages...I suppose i just wanted to share this with the few people on the internet who wont be judgemental about it.",2.0

its been building and building over the past few months, the feeling of just complete boredom with life. i can't get excited about anything. i don't care about finding love, or going out, or doing well at university, or getting a job. i don't give a crap about any of it, i don't have enough motivation or perseverance for the trials and tribulations of life. even if putting in effort would mean i could find those little pockets of happiness and ""meaning"" in llife, to me it is way too much effort. i'm not happy with being and doing nothing, but i don't care enough about life to change. 

i don't know what to do anymore, i can't make myself excited about anything. i feel dulled. i've been on antidepressants for a while now but they don't help with the empty feelings, which are the main reason for the suicidal thoughts. I just can't see myself ever getting the will to make life interesting, so why bother with life atall? i'm biding my time until i die, so it seems logical to get it over with now. 

i don't know what do anymore, the thoughts are becoming more and more frequent and i'm sick of trying to convince myself that something amazing is out there for me, when it feels like a complete lie.

"My mother will lead me to my death.Let me emphasize, I know that my mother has had a tough childhood and even adulthood. She’s been through a lot and during our argument I’ve stated that and said that I completely understand that her life has been “tougher” than mine. But because she’s an immigrant she thinks that my life in a better country is perfect and full of no problems. During my youth she’s kicked me out of the house for minimal things. The one that we just got into an argument about, just a few minutes ago, was whether the time she kicked me out of the house for not washing everyone’s dishes the day before my high school graduation. To clarify, I washed my own dishes as per our agreement. I just came home and I instantly did my own dishes. She then assumed that I was mad at her for not washing everyone’s dishes and just my own. I didn’t talk to her yet but she just assumed that I was mad cause I was doing my part of the agreement. Now she argues, after years after the incident, that washing everyone’s dishes is the “common sense” thing to do. Let me just say that this wasn’t the only time I’ve been kicked out. I’ve been kicked out for two weeks during Christmas twice because I wouldn’t plug the colour-coordinated plugs in the T.V. when she was standing right in front of it with all of my extended family members. You know the ones that literally has the same colours as the plugs they go into the T.V. None of my family members even helped me. I’m so done. I don’t want to be here anymore. It’s so infuriating to be told that cause “my life has been harder than yours, all the stuff I do to you is nothing or was your fault”. 

She acts like she’s intelligent but all of her knowledge comes from Facebook. I’m so done. She doesn’t know how to parent. If I do continue to live, I sure do hope that the children I rise will feel appreciated and loved. Not like how I was raised.",2.0

"I wish I could die in my sleep, but also make ""practice"" attempts (passive vs active suicidal?)I'm usually passively suicidal and wish that: (1) I could sleep forever and never wake up, (2) I was never born, or (3) I could die peacefully in my sleep. Sometimes I feel like a burden on my family - like they deserve better than me - but I know rationally that taking the final step would crush them, so I won't do it. On paper I have a good life and lots of opportunities, and other people out there have much worse, so I have no right to commit suicide anyway. 

I've been fantasizing about a comforting, peaceful death for a while, and recently started learning about different methods. I used to take the pill bottles out and just stare at the pills before putting them away. Today on an impulse I tied a sheet around my neck and tied it to the doorknob, but untied it right away, before it even started to get tight. So basically ""practicing"" how I would do it, even though I genuinely do not plan to attempt or put my family through the consequences of an attempt.

(yeah, I'm so useless I can't even find the guts to make a proper attempt).

Is this still passive suicidiality? Has anyone else experienced passive ideation but still ""rehearse"" for an attempt you never plan on seeing through?  Am I the only one who finds this practice to be comforting, even if it serves no purpose? Would admitting this behavior to a therapist take me straight to the hospital? Maybe nobody will answer, but I thought what the hell, might as well make a throwaway to ask.",2.0

"""I'm so very tired, please just sing me to sleep, sing to me... deep inside of my heart I really want to go."" I don't know what to do.Morrissey couldn't of put it better. I'm just so tired of my monotonous life, I've finished school just about to start sixth form &amp; I feel like I'm going mad, it feels like I've been having some sort of suicidal thought whether it's momentary or not every other day for the past month. 

I really hate my school &amp; am partly glad to be leaving but I just can't bring myself to start again &amp; reinvent myself for the next 2 years. I've got my school leavers dance in two weeks time &amp; I'm fucking petrified. There's a girl in my year whom I have a massive crush on, there's just something about her we'll call her ""Jane"", However when I bucked up the courage to ask Jane to prom she told people that she had no intention of going with me, yes I was angry in the way she went about it but I still ***really*** like her. 

There's another girl who we'll call ""Sarah"", we met online a few months back &amp; she's the same age, we get on really well, she's really attractive (she's got such pretty eyes) but she lives quite a few hours away from me. I don't know what to do, I don't really want another long distance relationship, my previous relationship was long distance &amp; that was a disaster.

I'm nervous about telling Jane how I really feel in case it goes in one ear &amp; out the other, like the old saying goes *""When you die your regret the things you  didn't than the things you did""*. I'm scared that within the next few days if not weeks I'll attempt suicide because I can't cope with the changes that are taking place around me. I don't know what to do.

Posting here because the mods over at /r/relationships said it might fit better and removed my post there. I hope this is allowed, if not, no problem.

  


She told me this afternoon, and I just tried to be as supportive as possible. She said she hasn't had suicidal thoughts in a couple of years, but that she realises that doesn't mean they won't ever come back.

  


She's been to a bunch of psychologists in the past few years and it seems to have helped a lot.

  


The main reason she did this, was that her parents divorced and just were both really complicated, kind of fucked up people. She told me in the beginning that she never wanted to have kids (apparently because of this), but a while back she told me that, with me, she'd see a future with kids.

  


I come from a very stable, chill family, so I have no experience with this.

  


Basically I'm looking for some advice from people who've been in similar situations. Stuff that I need to keep in mind, avoid,...

  


Thanks in advance.

"WhateverNobody will read this, but I need to get it off my chest. 

I don't think I really have a right to feel this way. When I was younger in school, I wasn't completely alone. People tried to be friends with me, but I was always too awkward, too uncomfortable, or too afraid to reciprocate. 

No matter what I tried, I couldn't interact with anyone without being awkward and uncomfortable. If I ever got close to anyone, I was too much of a trainwreck to keep them around. It's sad how many people have tried to be my friend, only to have me find some way to drive them back. 

And now here I am, as a working adult. My peers are all getting married, figuring out their lives. And I'm here, a miserable wreck who had to use the word ""peers"" because I simply don't have friends. There's no room for a broken person like me in their lives anymore. Just when I was starting to think that maybe I could improve, it's just not the place in life anymore where I can be anything but alone. 

I learned a long time ago not to believe anyone when they say they're willing to help. When they're there for me. I've made the mistake of believing that. I don't blame them, I don't blame anyone for trying. But there hasn't been a person alive who truly understands that there is no point. If you feel like I'm at the spot where you feel the need to tell me ""I'm here if you need me,"" it's too late. I've already fucked up.",2.0

I've had an eating disorder off and on since I was 11, but it didn't really begin to get bad until 8 and 9th grade...my mother responded to it by getting angry and threatening me. I was forced to recover but still struggle. Presently, I switch between periods of starving myself and cutting myself. 

I am going into my senior year of high school, and am being pressured to pick a college to apply to. I don't know how I can make such a big decision. I don't know what to do. I don't want to fall into a miserably boring career. My teacher encourages me to go to art school, saying I'm good enough to go to Art Center or RISD, but I couldn't stand failing and my parents treating me with the ""I told you so"" mentality. I just don't see how the future holds anything for me. I am scared of going off alone. 

I don't have my license to drive yet, which attributes to my extremely low feelings of self worth. My parents seemed eager to help my twin brother get his license and even bought him a car...but they never seem willing to help me. I wish they would help me, but I don't know how to ask for it. Because of my lack of mobility, I alienate myself from my friends for fear that they judge me. 

I push people away from me because I don't like myself. Any boys that express interest in dating me I discourage. I don't want to be responsible for the happiness of another. I can't imagine anyone liking me when I even find myself repulsive. 

These are the basic issues I have right now. I couldn't even begin to address everything else that goes on in my head. Everything is too overwhelming for me. I don't understand how people deal with their lives. Why is it so hard for me? I don't want to go through another year of misery. I think about suicide often. I have easy access to 243mg of prescription sleeping pills and bottles of prescription antidepressants. I could overdose easily. I am also okay with slitting my wrists or my femoral artery.

"shit is crazy and I think I’m going insanemy mind is slowly falling apart and I’m having psychotic breakdowns every night. it’s indescribably painful. im in a loop of ‘I can just kill myself and I won’t have to deal with all this shit’ and ‘killing myself is the best option’ but then I think about all the loose ends I haven’t tied up and think ‘i should try to stay a little longer’ but then I loop back to ‘well if I kill myself, none of this will matter anyways.’

it’s starting to settle in that I might actually do it. soon too.  it’s a scary thought but also not at all at the same time. 

I just want to die. I don’t think there’s much wrong with that. If people knew, they’d probably say ‘what about other people? Think about them.’ Fuck no. You think I should force myself to continue to live in a psychologicallly painful state just so a couple of people won’t have to go through the grieving process? Fuck you. ‘Things will get better.’ Really? Tell me when then. And how. Truthfully when I look at our society and our civilization itself, I hate it. I hate living in this day and age. And when I look at my future, I don’t see anything to look forward too. I’m not gonna live some miracle story where I suddenly become a millionaire and fine the loml. There’s literally nothing I want in my future. It doesn’t matter anyways because once ur dead, nothing will matter and ur state of being and emotions are so meaningless. We live pathetic little lives that we desperately try to put so much meaning to and end up the same anyways. Dead. I hate everyone. 

Sometimes I wonder if this is just a phase. Everyone says shit like this is a phase. Does it hurt this much to other people though? I feel insane. Like those mental hospital patients in movies. Everyone says it’s puberty. You’re just angsty, you’ll grow out of it. I guess no one really takes you seriously when you’re fifteen.

Jesus fuck. Everything hurts in my head. It feels like it’s splitting open and I feel like I’m going insane. There’s too many thoughts and voices. Im not even sure what’s real. I just want it to all stop. I want this reality to stop. My brain won’t stop reminding of everything that makes me want to die. If I just killed myself, it could all stop. Everything could stop.

"Advice, support, anything for a mom of a 13 year old who wants to dieGod I love this kid.  She is the most amazing thing in the world.  And she wants to die.  Maybe not die, but make the world stop hurting her.  

She is struggling with anxiety beyond measure.  She doesn't want to go to school.  She has hurt herself.  Twice we have had to take her in for a safety check.  She is still not okay.  A good counselor has been found.  

Prozac made it worse.  We are trying something else now.  She is lying to me about it.  I know she texted the hotline yesterday and lied about what is going on and then when I asked her if she is reaching out  she said no.  I think she lies because she doesn't feel like she has a ""reason"" to be this way.  

While I had her phone I texted the hotline and asked what to do on the thread they had.  I told them she is making things up and we agreed better text them than friends and I deleted my interaction so she won't know, I know.  She tells them we yell at her, sold her horse out of spite (um we have a fish, but no horse) that she sits on railroad tracks and jumps off just as a train gets there (the only railroad tracks she can get to are dormant) that we have grounded her..... she told all this to a friend out of town last week and we ended up in a cop car to the hospital.  

But I'm not mad, she is that desperate.  She doesn't know how to do emotion.  3 years ago a foster teen daughter came and the house went from painfully emotionless to chaotic.  In march her cousin killed himself at 18, he was gay and schizophrenic.  I've always had in the back of my mind that my daughter may be gay.  In April we told them we were divorcing and in July, I moved out.  In august she had to run for her life to escape a house fire.  And then my little crowd hating introvert went from an outdoor school of 50 to 7th grade.  

So I get it.  I get the hell out of it.  And I see the bright future ahead of her.  Maybe even 6 month from now.  But how do I help her find it now?  How do I keep her living long enough to push through this?  I'm getting desperate.  I'm scared.  I needed someone to tell this to.  Thank you for listening. ",2.0

I know my life is fucking great but I just don't want to pursue it. I don't understand how this happened or what made me slip into this, but I know that if it keeps up I'm just going to let my life slide until its basically as good as gone.

As of right now, I'm making it work. I force myself to wake up in the morning, put on makeup and a decent outfit, force myself to sit down with my readings. If I don't, I'll stop altogether. I'll stop getting out of bed. I'll stop reaching for my laptop. Everything would just stop.

"I feel more and more isolated each day, and no one around me knows or cares how bad things are...I'm not very good at talking about my feelings and I don't think I've ever shared everything I'm about to but I'm so tired of having to constantly keep things to myself, having to edit and censor conversations so I don't make anyone uncomfortable - and ultimately having no one I can honestly and openly talk to.

It's not that I've never tried to reach out, I have - but I think people don't understand how bad things are because they never see me at my worst. Obviously I try to be cheerful and happy when I'm around other people, so when I try and talk to friends or family, they think it's a one-off bad moment/day rather than a moment expressing how I feel everyday. 

I feel like my only option is to end things because I know I'll never stop being depressed (it's been 7 years since I was first diagnosed) and each day is an exhausting battle and as petulant as it sounds there's no prize for winning the fight - you just get another shitty day to slog through.

I'm 23 and I cannot imagine living the rest of my life like this - people always insist things will get better and if they could give me a timeline I would believe that - but indefinitely waiting for something to change is just impossible. 

I feel alone despite having family and friends. 
I feel unloved and like everyone hates me, despite people insisting they care for me. 
I feel like a giant failure with regards to the degree I've tried to get this past year. 
I feel so embarrassed about being such a mess when I should be getting my life together and starting out properly. 
I feel so guilty for what I will (eventually) do and how horrible it'll make my loved ones feel.
I feel like a burden anytime I say something to anyone and try to share it. 
I feel angry and frustrated because people say things like ""don't be so negative"" or ""just think positive!"" when I try to share my concerns and worries. 
I feel like I'm at such a dead end and I desperately wish someone could help me, but deep down I know that this is the sort of problem you have to fix for yourself, and I just don't have it in me to keep trying to fix it - especially because I have to do it on my own.

"The creeping has caught up to meEver since I can remember I've been nihilistic about the future and gradually my depression has gotten worse. I thought when I occasionally thought about suicide back in high school that that was as bad as it gets and I'll be fine but with every passing day of my life it's just gotten worse. I've never wanted to love, there's nothing I want - no partner, no kids, nothing to accomplish. I've never had a reason to stay except things weren't hard enough to warrant leaving. I was living at home and surviving but every day getting closer to working has been worse. Went to uni to delay having to work so I could get welfare for study. Study got harder and harder and I wasn't that interested so I haven't finished my bachelor, I still have a subject left.   Now my full time Uni time is over, I have to work and nothing can bring me to want to do it. I've had a few jobs over my life including retail, hospitality and farming so I do have experience I just don't want to work, for a future where I'm still alive where all I'll be doing is working. All my life is is staying alive. If I have to work to do that I'm just gonna end up killing myself. I don't think depression is a valid reason for disability support so I'm left with three choices: 
1-work and support myself for the next ~60 years but that thought makes me want to end it now. 
2-become homeless so I can at least be alive so my former (been reclusive for over a year now) friends and family don't feel bad, feel like they should have done something, like if I ended it but this would give them a chance to suffer through trying to help me 
Or 3- just end it now and leave a note explaining everything and hope everyone can accept my situation. 
Honestly I wish you could talk about suicidality without the fear of being locked up in a mental hospital or whatever they do but you can't so you have to keep it in until it wins. 
And it feels like it's about to win. 
Got an appointment at 9am tomorrow and if I don't make it I won't get my benefits, but I don't think I'll be able to sleep as is normal for me so I'll toss and turn until around 4am an be expected to wake up at 7:30 to get ready to leave. I know I can't do this for 3 weeks straight but I'm left with little choice. Is suicidal thoughts a valid reason to get a doctors certificate for missing an appointment with welfare people's? I'm just sitting here scared I won't be able to get myself there on time and that I'll be homeless this time next month. Any advice? Help? I don't know.. ",2.0
